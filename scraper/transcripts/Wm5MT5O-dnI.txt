rebuilding and in the coming weeks and months our party will initiate a process to select a new leader and in the meantime it's our duty as Canada's official opposition to keep a watchful eye on Justin Trudeau's Liberal government you know Justin fine to spend money that we don't have will mean fewer jobs and higher taxes and this is just simply the wrong direction for our country and that's why we need your help today to put us on track for a successful 2016 oh goodness yes yes yeah of course you know so welcome to the Conservative Party can count on you today with a tax receivables contributing of $200 for which you get 150 of that back as a tax credit so to ensure that we can accomplish our goals for 2016 can we count on you for that is someone someone did kids say last week
