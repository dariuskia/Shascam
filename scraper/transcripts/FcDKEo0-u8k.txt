again Raymond my name is Raymond with metal or the medical or dealer well it's I that you should pull because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and you know she sees me she is very smile I'll give about because you know she was the first family go to university and see how specifically you know where we're all about it oh yeah so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it okay well so you are familiar with the immunity me commercials for these for the for them or someone's an emergency situation and they need help so I struggle with your quite catchy catchy level what was that again we have you ever seen the TV commercials where someone is an emergency situation and need help they press the little pin it button on them sorry but it is it's uh it's a neck and wrist pendant that you can wear around your dependents you can wear it around your nest erect if you have a medical emergency press the button and it will talk to a monitoring station operator and they can either call either a relative or neighbor or you know emergency 911 11 ways you want to set up for yeah just a few medical questions and if you wanna see if you qualify for a promotion that can go over the full details of the medical alert system for you that fair enough would you say that again like in please I'm a few medical questions few yes or no questions to go over if you qualify for today's promotion then we can go over the details of the medical alert system okay yes yes yes okay in the last five years have you had surgeries sorry which company would you say you're calling from again med alert well can i meed something because the last time that I've someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got it quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know that but it's been that's really good and sometimes in family you know these these things are most important you know if they're more important than any you know gobble or phone call or whatever whatever it is yes I understand basically what is just just to make sure this is a system that set up to make sure that you were safe in case of any medical emergency happens to arrive they have help for you is right at the push of a button either and it can be set up call maybe your daughter relative you know I mean any relative you want a neighbor or even 911 in case you have any kind of medical emergency oh yeah sisters since you put it that way I mean you you've been quite friendly and straightforward with here hello yes sir come this way are you there yes sir I'm here I'm listening to you oh yes sorry I have to have a bit of a bit of a problem that this phone and my hearing is not so good yes sorry what we are saying again okay I'm well alright what I'm it's a medical the medical base unit is plugged into your plug into wall connects your standard telephone jack it will come with a choice of a neck or wrist pendant and the pendant is pre-programmed to medical alert system so it can be used immediately once it is installed the neck and the wrist parents are both water resistant so they can be worn in the bath shower so you have to worry about you know falling while you're in the bathroom that's where fifty two percent of the fault happen is so let me talk you through a potential scenario how this device works ok let's say you're taking a shower and you slip and fall on the top you can't move so you can just press the button on the pendant it'll immediately beep so you know that's made contact with the base unit at that time the monitoring station operator will be talking to you through the speaker asking how they can help you now you may not want or need an ambulance at your front door but you really have a neighbor relative call first our operator will make that call for you you'll stay on the line with you until the neighbor or relative arrives if your situation worsens or if the operator did not get an answer from you when you first press the button then they will call emergency services immediately now we don't have to panic because you know help is on the way in other words once you press the button we will take care of the rest well I know it with a panel finances the way I know you know we're not allowed expenses much as what we were how how I was a safe house escape plan you know I didn't really really supposed to ask you a couple medical questions but you know what what I could probably do what I can I can get you the equipment to you at no cost to you okay all
