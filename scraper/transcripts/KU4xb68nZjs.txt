lower interest rate oh good yes this is just a ballpark figure how much total credit card debt you have altogether is this someone someone did kids say last week no did someone did call us week about the same thing what was it was that phew um so I'm not really sure to be honest with you but on so just a ballpark figure how much debt do you have yeah sorry what was your name again my name is Jessica ride well it's funny about insurance poor people are dead my third eldest Larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and yeah she's she is very smart I'll give about it because you know she was the first family to go to university and she passed with other actions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get little bit look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well the reason we're calling is because wherever you sign for your credit cards or visibility online 34 of your terms and agreements it stated that all credit card accounts would be monitored and placed up for review by one of the three major credit bureaus to receive a lower interest rate my job is just to make sure that you are in good standings as of 6:00 a.m. by checking your next payment last payment balance interest rate and just making sure that you are not maxed out so once we do that if you are a qualified today we can actually get your rates down as low as possible for you that way whenever you make your monthly payments they can stop taking all your money and putting them onto those high interest rates they'll start going towards paying off that debt and another thing I do want to mention is this is not debt consolidation or debt management so it will not affect your present in any shape or form this is just something that you answer yourself by making your payments on time so watch it because you live it what was that again which one of our lenders you owe the majority of your debt to the mr. sorry where again which one of the credit cards do you load of us that Joe would you say that again again please which credit card do you owe the most debt to yes yes you said chase sorry which company did you say you're calling from again
