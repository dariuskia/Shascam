[ __ ] barely hear you there that better yes this is hello ok this is Avalon auto protections how are you today oh good yes yes yes good ok it looks like you may have a car that's out of warranty is that right oh yes yes someone someone kids say last week no did someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you I don't think it was me personally it might have been this company or another company but we do offer a service contracts on cars that are out of warranty to keep them running without running up big Bill's on your behalf with that interest you at all if sorry what was your name again my name is Scott what's your name well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just just last week and you know she she know she is very smart give her bad because you know she was the first to the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well a service contract takes over when the warranty on your car expires and what it's designed to do is avoid big bills in the future on your part I mean it's inevitable that the car is going to break down eventually I mean they're not built to last forever how did something big were to happen like your transmission or your engine talking thousands of dollars so the idea is you pay a little bit each month at the beginning protect your car for three four or five years into the future so when something big does go wrong you don't have to dip into your pockets we the company pay for you it's like an insurance policy on the car itself on the working parts of the car that making sense I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you label what was that again okay am I not loud enough but the litter sorry again okay am I not loud enough are you having trouble hearing me sir would you say that again again please okay am i loud enough can you hear me ok if I ish ok a service contract is sort of like insurance for the moving parts of your car sorry if you and currently do I may be far from again ok how about if I call you back in a few minutes that we get a better connection that way well you know here's here's the thing because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or phone call or what in doing what any negative six question how about if I talk directly to her hello are you there there can you hear me oh yes sorry sorry what were you saying
