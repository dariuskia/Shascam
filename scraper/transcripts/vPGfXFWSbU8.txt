with the person responsible for the utility bill uh sorry I'm [ __ ] barely hear this okay well I need to speak with the person responsible for the utility bill it guess is you are with our national grid correct oh good yes yes yes okay well the reason why you're receiving this phone call is so you can get price protection added to your account this is totally free because of the state program and it's my job to facilitate there for you today sir before the window rates kick in and the prices go up all I need you to do is grab a copy of your bill and a pen and a piece of paper and I hole while you do so oh yes yes someone someone did say last week and they did someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you I know they're probably not uh what radar you can are you currently paying right now it just sorry what was your name again my name is cardio well it is nothing that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just just last week and you know she's she is very smart I'll give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she asked with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it okay well basically third digit articles or I could tell nobody's brought the program now for you are basically right now this program is brought about by the voters arm of the state and it would put in power played to help you guys out with the cost of your electricity in the cost of your gas arm last you guys have a pretty nasty winter and it kind of shows the prices of gas and electricity up and a lot of people felt that and so on they came out with this program with you the customer choice program that is basically designed to keep you guys forget any kind of rate increases on your bill um I don't know if you understand deregulation or whatever but on national grid does not make electricity they don't make gas they purchased it all from suppliers in and that's what we are willing to ply you with national grid and that's why you're able to get a low weight because instead of you getting your gas or your electricity off the open market which is currently what stirs what you're doing oh now you'll have a supplier on your bill and the thing is you're never double billed or anything like that like I say we're just a supplier so uh on a national grid and so what happens is oh we thought supplying you with the electricity at a low rate in basically National Grid just delivers it to you that's what it get paid to do they deliver arm energy that's the whole reason why have you ever paid attention to build a safe delivery charges that's all because that's what they're getting paid to do deliver it to you and I'm basically like I say right now you're you're subject the open market rates you don't want that because what's kind of happen is typically done one a month the purchase for our gas and electricity typically rides because demand is higher and on that's the whole reason for this there's a copy it's totally free it doesn't switch you over anything like that gives you agreeing that uh you know we can supply with the electricity at a lower rate I'm sorry I give that I couldn't quite catch it catch your label hole shut again okay this is basically just owe me making sure that you qualify for this because not everybody qualifies for this program like I was saying and it is designed to help
