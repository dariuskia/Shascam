I'll give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know they're all quite proud of her yes yes so yeah yeah saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing um so perfect perfect time that I called right well basically we asked 60 days of the account you know um within that 60 days uh you know if you were happen to take your account back we asked 10% because you know that we lead us to believe that you would be hand our back and settled with the DE after we put time in money and already you know trying to collect for you and then you know it's a no recovery no fee service so if you can't recover your money within the 60 days then you know you're more than welcome to take your account back we ask 20% C cat you there what was that again yeah we we ask 20% upon recovery it's a no recovery no fee service and uh we enforce right offs can you hear me good sir would you say that again again please oh it's a it's a no recovery uh no fee service contingency basis we ask a 20% upon recovery uh if we don't get you paid we don't get paid and if you don't we don't get you paid you don't know it's a single penny and then uh we enforce writeoffs we enforce leans we enforce judgments if you have those too and then in New York where you guys are at the stats allow us to go back six years
