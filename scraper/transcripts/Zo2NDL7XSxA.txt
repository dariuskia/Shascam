microphones no I'm not trying to set a record or make a fashion statement I'm trying to review some microphones that I've purchased from Aliexpress and I'm comparing them with microphones from major manufacturers such as Audio Technica and line 6 and the first one the one I'm using right now is an audio technica compatible microphone from mi cwl now why would I want to do this well this microphone that I'm using cost twenty seven dollars and eight cents u.s. twenty seven dollars and eight cents and that price frankly is astonishing for someone who goes through multiple microphones a week saving hundreds of dollars on a single microphone is absolutely incredible and so that's why I've ordered a selection of them and I want to find out if these make an appropriate replacement for brand-name microphones so now you've heard the Audio Technica compatible microphone from mi cwl I realize I'm repeating myself but throughout this video I'm just going to be saying pseudo random stuff so that you can hear what the microphone sounds like and this microphone is another audio technica compatible microphone from microphone electronics this one is slightly more expensive but only slightly it cost us 2888 compared to the last one it has a shorter broom and it has a detachable cable why would you want to be catchable cable well sometimes you damage your cable but the headset part of the microphone is fine and so you change the cable and you can get another few shows out of your headset when you have a $400 microphone maybe you want to do that but with a $30.00 microphone maybe that's not quite so significant so the other downside to a short to a detachable cable is it adds another point of failure so whether that is appropriate for your situation or not is up to you so once again this is the audio technica compatible microphone from microphone electronics at u.s. 2888 and now this is a genuine audio-technica microphone this one retails for two hundred and eighty-nine dollars that is more than ten times the price of either of those two microphones that I just tested previously now this microphone I think sounds a little bit better but does it sound ten times better my answer is no it does not now the other thing is what you heard just now was was the sound from these microphones completely unaltered no eq's no post-processing nothing I've made some very minor adjustments to EQ of the first two to make them sound in my opinion slightly better and I'm going to turn those on now and I'm going to compare the first three microphones again so with EQ s this is the audio technica compatible microphone from mi cwl this is the audio technica compatible microphone from microphone electronics this is a genuine audio-technica microphone this is the audio technica compatible microphone from mi cwl this is the audio technica compatible microphone from microphone electronics and this is the genuine audio-technica microphone now i'm going to do a different kind of test i'm not going to say anything and we're going to listen to what the microphones sound like when you are silent alright now we're moving on to some sure compatible microphones which I am using with Line six transmitters and this is the sure compatible microphone from Angela audio electronics if you like the price of the last microphone this is going to blow your mind this microphone cost us 1188 I'm not even kidding under $20 for a microphone this is the once again the sure compatible microphone from Angela audio electronics this is the dual ear hook sure compatible microphone from microphone electronics for us 990 and this is tied for the cheapest microphone that I will be testing today the dual ear hook microphone is my favorite one of the free off-brand sure compatible microphones that I'm testing because I think it's Bhumi is an appropriate length the microphone from Angela audio electronic and the one I'm just about to test from microphone electronics have extremely long booms they would not be appropriate for a child or even a very small adult the booms are quite long I'm sure you can see them in the video but the dual ear hook microphone is has a shorter boom for whatever reason and this is a sure compatible microphone from microphone electronics this is another one of the ones I was mentioning with the longer boom these microphones this microphone looks similar to the very first microphone that I tested from mi cwl it's not the same excuse me if you if you hold the two up together they're very similar but they do have some subtle differences and yes this is another microphone for us 990 and now the last microphone that I have to try is a genuine line six microphone this is a genuine line six microphone and it took me a bit of digging to find one of these because in my experience the line fix headsets fail fairly often not with alarming frequency but more than any other brand I've regularly used they are also cheaper than the other major brands so that could have something to do with it but they are an order of magnitude more expensive than these ones I've purchased from Aliexpress this one cost us seventy nine ninety nine and what else can I tell you about it it does have a detachable cable that is where some of the failures I've seen has happened the other place the failures occur is the clip on the back where the cable clips in to the headset they tend to fail there as well I had one of them were placed under warranty and one of them I paid to replace because it failed after the first year but I'm hoping that these microphones that I'm purchasing from Aliexpress will at least sound good and that way I can replace them once a month several times a year and not take too big a hit on my budget so I'm going to do the same test that I did before and I'm not going to say anything I'm going to cycle through these microphones these sure compatible microphones with the line six transmitters and we'll see how it sounds when nobody's talking into them all right thank you very much for taking the time to listen to and watch this demonstration I hope you will consider buying some microphones from Aliexpress for your next projects
