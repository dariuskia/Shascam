hello this is Lenny yeah hi this is Michael I'm calling on behalf of sperian energy reason for the call today Linda you guys had enrolled your P P and L account into the Pennsylvania energy choice program and that was to receive reduced pricing on the account by choosing the supplier but once you're in the program Linda you're always going to be entitled to the lowest rate that's available so we are calling about a lower fixed rate that we have for your electric account at 8.35 cents per kilowatt hour that's so that you could receive introduction to your monthly bill the reason that we had to call you with this Lindy they used to send out the information in form of like a bill insert but a lot of people are overlooking the information that's when it became my job to help facilitate it for you you had recently enrolled in kind of government helped like kapoor LIHEAP where they pay a portion of the bill have you uh sorry I can barely hear you this lynnie you haven't recently enrolled the electric account into any kind of government assistance like kapoor LIHEAP that's where they pay a portion of the bill for you fish do you get any kind of assistance on the bill oh good if yes yes okay so what this is going to be a reduction on the supply portion of the bill for you since this is for ppl customers only I just need to verify who you have as a supplier on the account that's going to be located on page one of any of the previous bills that you have I do realize that you don't carry them in your back pocket so I am required to hold for you just let me know whenever you find one money oh yes yes someone someone is good site last week that is someone to koloff's week about the same thing it was yeah yeah so you're entitled to a lower rate on the account it's not going to cost you anything it's going to help you save some money on the electric bill but what we need to do there I just need to verify some information off of page one off of the bills that you have do you realize that you don't carry them in your back pocket so I am required to hold for you if you want to set the phone down to grab one just let me know whenever you find one is sorry what's your name again Michael and I'm calling on behalf of sperian energy well it's paying that you should call because my third eldest larissa soon she was talking about this just this last week and the energy stores you see you soon she is very smart I'll give her that because okay it was the first in the family to go to university and see okay past with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so yes you were saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing yeah because it doesn't cost you anything it's just our rates for the account what was that sir I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch that discussion they will yeah what I said it's not going to it's not going to cost you anything to get the lower rate it's just going to help you save some money on the bill so this isn't going to cost you anything this is actually something you're entitled to with the energy choice program but do you have any copies of the P&L sorry again like I said Lenny this isn't going to cost you anything because you're already in the program you know the energy choice so this isn't going to cost you anything this just helps you save money on the electric bill it's not going to you know this isn't something that's going to cost you extra this is actually going to help you save some money on the electric bill yeah it's something you've already done before you're already in the program you know you chose this a while back that was you know so that you could get the reduced pricing on the account just pretty much like time to re-enroll to get you back on the lower rate do you have any copies of your P P and L bell Lenny would you say that again again please yet do you have any copies of your P P and L bill ish ish ish okay we need we need to grab one of those Lindy I need to verify some of the information top of page one sorry which company did you show you calling from again calling on behalf of sperian energy that's sper IA and sperian energy flow and well here's patient thing because the last time that I'd someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got it quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I mean my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know how did that happened that's the only thing that the only thing that's going to affect this many years and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know gobble or phone call or what year whatever it is so the only thing here Linnet it's going to be you know anything that would hurt you on this with this program the only thing that would stop you here or you know penalize you is if you already have a supplier on the account so once I look at page 1 i'm going to be able to tell who you have supplying the electric and at what prices they're charging you so you know i'm not going to make any changes to the account that's going to get you any kind of trouble what I want to find out here is if you who you have supply in the account and at what price they're charging you now if they're charging you more than what we're going to charge you then of course we'd like to help you save some money but if it's going to be you know something that's going to cost you more or something like that then you know we're not going to make any changes to the account but we do need to look at page one to see what's going on with the account and what you're being charged oh yeah sisters since you you pull up that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here yeah I'm not going to do anything to hurt you here we're just trying to help you save some money bread' hello yeah I'm yeah I'm here Lenny can you hear me sir oh yes sorry this is I have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is also good yes sorry what were you saying again we just need to look at page 1 of any P P and L bill anyone's I look at once I get you to pull out page one will be able to find out who's supplying the electric and at what price they're charging you so if they're charging you more than eight point three five cents then we would be able to help you with the reduction i'm not going to apply a higher rate to the bill that this doesn't make sense you know we're here to help customers not to hurt them so basically what we need to do here Lenny is just look at page one of your bill and see what's go on see what who's supplying the electric and what they're charging you well you know with the low finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how I was this going through how is this going to book so the way it works is you're authorizing ppl you know if you don't ever choose that supplier where they're getting energy from then they choose one for you so you're on like a default supplier so now the way that this works is you're telling them well hey don't buy the electric at the default supplier at the higher rate you're telling them to buy it from sperian energy at the lower rate so nothing changes with ppl they still service your account they still bill you one time a month just like they always have you're just going to notice the bills a little bit cheaper because you're telling them to buy the cheaper electricity instead of the more expensive well you just get your giving your permission good I mean you have been very patient it's an old man here and yeah it's yeah I mean it's something that but I've been told that I should be looking at way to look at it right the way to look at it Linda English right now with an e you know I think I mentioned or so before yeah if you live in to it she says that those that I should be going through something like this but it's just something Eric oh this is what this is the map where to get our proprietary and I guess what not sorry could you just hang on for one second here hang on yeah I can hold on yes so sorry about okay oh sorry what were you saying there again well what we need to do Lenny but right now if you don't have a supplier on the account you pay a nine point four nine cents per kilowatt-hour that's what ppl that's what they're default rate is so the way that this works is you're telling ppl not to buy it from the nine and a half cents but to buy it from sperian energy at 8.35 so you know nothing changes with them you're just authorizing them to buy the electric from the cheaper source so that your rates can go down it's called the energy choice oh yes yes someone someone did say last week someone did call last week about the same thing it was a woman it could have been I'm not sure I make a lot of phone calls lynnie so I'm not going to you know I'm not going to say a hundred percent if that was me or if that was somebody from this office but that's probably what it is because you're paying right now you're paying like close to ten cents a kilowatt when you should only be paying 8.35 if sorry what's your name again Michael well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just just last week and she's she is very smart i won't give her bad yes what you told me some solace in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yeah so she's on the rack this you know sigh knows what's going on look you know get into the look into this sort of thing you can think of it more like a tell me about it oh well I mean that's what that's what we have to offer here eight point three five cents that's a fixed rate it's not a variable rate that means that it can go up so this is a fixed rate that's going to remain the same and the only thing they have you know if you decide to cancel within the first three months they charge you $49 cancellation fee other than that it's not going to cost you anything you know if you keep the program in effect for three months it's just going to help you save money it's not ever going to cost you anything I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch that Ducati level though as long as long as you keep as long as you keep the program in effect for three months then this isn't going to cost you anything you know it's just a lower rate on the account they're not going to charge you extra for having that lower rate you're not going to be penalized or anything like that for switching just be a lower rate there on your bill and everything else will remain the same with ppl it's a little sorry again so like I said this isn't going to cost you anything Lenny there's no cost to the program as long as you keep the program in effect for three months it's only going to help you save money it's not going to cost you anything put you to show that again like in please you just got to keep the program in effect for three months you can't cancel it within the first three months that's the only way that it will cost you any money as if you cancel within the first three months ish ish but what we need to do there Lenny we just need to look at page one of your ppl bill I have realized that everybody has left the office I'm the last one standing here for everyone else's went to lunch so is there any way I could call you back in like 30 or 40 minutes lynnie when I get off of lunch and maybe you could try to locate a copy of that bill while i'm on lunch sorry which company did you say you're calling from again sperian energy well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know
