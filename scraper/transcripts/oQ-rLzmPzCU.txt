doing today uh sorry I'm [ __ ] belly here you there oh sorry about that can you hear a little better yes yes can you hear Lenny okay okay yes sir yes sir now Lenny my name is Casey I'm just calling it today here from access now and the reason for my phone call is simple Lenny I was I was actually just on your guys's web site there and I did just have a couple of questions for you now Lenny are you the one that would be taking care of that matter oh good yes yes yes okay certainly certainly and you know to be honest with you Lenny I'll tell you it's not in reference to any type of changes or nothing like that the website is perfectly fine I'm simply all the reason for our phone call - is Lenny is just in regards to the actual amount of clientele that is currently being produced on to that web page and actually how many of those are translating into sales for you and your business okay Lenny the the process in which my company does here is and we actually send you industry specific customers to your web page and into your business every single day okay so what that means Lenny is you know consumers that are of course relative to your location or in a relative to really whatever area that you would like but more importantly Lenny these are customers that are already going to be looking for your services okay from there it then becomes my job to be able to number one drive them onto your web page and in return get them into your business okay does that make sense oh yes yes someone someone did say last week that someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you you know it may have been me Lenny you we may have spoken there last week I'm not I'm not exactly sure but what I did just have I just had your name and and your number written down and I was just informed to you know call you and just be able to go over all this there because you know you guys have a beautiful website okay so you look at it this way if I'm able to start driving customers to that website that are already looking for your services letting you know that is just going to start increasing your sales dramatically each month you know and all Alaska what's kind of the main one of the main what's the main thing that you guys sell there at the business is sorry what would what's your name again yes sir and again Lennie my name is Casey well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larisa she she was talking about god just just last week and she she's oh he's very smart I won't give her bad because you know she was the first in the family history at a university and she passed with distinction so you know we're we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more tell me about it certainly so you know essentially Lenny this is the way it works okay so you know to your guyses website what we are able to do is send anywhere and you know the figures that I typically use are really anywhere Lenny from 2 all the way up to 15 thousand consumers onto your website throughout the course of a month okay now I mean you know obviously we're not going to be able to get all of those thousands of people to do business with you obviously but you know Lenny there is going to be a turnover ratio on that you know there's going to be a percentage of those customers that are going to do business with you and that is what my job is my job is to be able to put a paying customer into your business okay and you know I will tell you Lenny that we do business here on a month-to-month basis okay there's no contracts there's nothing that you're ever locked into or tied down to ok it's simply the process of us saying Lenny you know this is what we are able to do are you and that is be able to drive you paying customers on a monthly basis and if I can't do that for you Lenny at the end of 30 days you're going to get your money back and we're going to shake hands and part ways as friends but I can tell you one thing you know after being in business out here in Denver Colorado for the last 16 years you know the one thing that we do take pride in is our ability to be able to drive you those paying customers and putting more money into your pocket at the end of the month and like I said Lenny hey if I can't do that for you then we're not going to be doing business together after 30 days so you know really the way it works you know the easiest example I can give you Lenny you know let's say for instance let's say you were to invest $100 a month into my business okay it would then become my job to turn around and put $500 or $1,000 into your pocket at the end of the month and that would make you a smart business owner am i right I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it because you label what was that again yes so so you know just just as an example you know let's say Lenny that you let's say that you invested $100 a month into my business okay it would it would then become my job to turn around and put a thousand dollars into your pocket at the end of the month okay does that make sense mr. schary again so so yes you know essentially Lenny you have to know that you're going to be making more money on the back end then you're paying on the front end right could you show that again again please yes yes Lenny so so you have to know that you're going to be making more money on the back end then you're paying on the front end correct yes yes does that make sense exactly exactly and that's what my job is Lenny my job is to be able to put a paying customer into your business okay my job is to put more money into your pocket at the end of them and that's what I'm going to do for you Lenny and if I can't do that then at the end of 30 days you're going to get your money back and we're not going to continue doing business together okay but for right now what I'm going to have you do is I'm going to have you try our program out okay you're going to have 30 days to see what it does for you and your business see the revenue it produces for you see the customers that it drives in to your business and then hey at the end of 30 days you know we'll talk from there but you know Lenny what I want to do for you here right now is you know really just be able to get some numbers put in front of you you know so that you can know exactly what's going on so that you can know Lenny okay this is how much of an investment it would be for you I want you to also know this is how many customers we would be able to send to your website as well as how many of those are going to translate into sales for you okay sorry which companies use I'm coming from again yes again Lenny I'm calling from access now hello okay you know what I'm gonna do something Rose the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me only on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that other words yes I think my eldest Rachel C she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and then sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any job or four phone call or or whatever whatever it is of course exactly and and you know like like I said you know your daughter's the smart one there you said so you know what I want to be able to do for you Lenny is you know at least be able to get all this information to you so that at least you can sit down with her and go over it together and decide if it's something that makes sense to you how does that sound oh yeah scissors since you you pull up that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello and and that's all my job is money I'm you know I'm not here to push it oh yeah I really push anything on you I'm not here to yeah yeah yeah I'm here oh yes sorry this is okay Lenny have a beer nope not a problem with this phone and my hearing it's not so good yes uh no problem sorry what were you saying again yeah so you know letting what what all that I want to be able to do for you today is you know just be able to get some information over to you so that at least you can sit down with your daughter and you guys can go over all of that and decide if it's something that makes sense to you well you know with the low finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were well how is this going true how is a skunk bug exactly so I'm going to drive paying customers into your business Lenny and that's going to put more money into your pocket at the end of the month and if I can't do that you're going to get your money back and we're going to shake hands and we're gonna part ways and that's why we do business month to month Lenny that's why you have 30 days every single month to make sure that we're doing what we say that we're doing okay so you ask how it works how it works is we're going to put a customer in your business that is already looking for your service okay and you know simply what that does is it increases your revenue each month it increases your profit margins each month that's my only job Lenny my only job here is to put paying customers into your business that is my only job in this matter is to put customers into your business and put more money into your pocket and if I can't do that then we're not going to continue doing business after a month okay well that that's does sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here and it's yeah I mean it's something that but I've been told that I should be looking at my third oldest original is she I think I mentioned Laura before yes yes she yeah she says that note that I should be going for the something like this but it's just a matter of what you know what is most appropriate from the exact the time and I guess what what is exactly what is it hang on for one second here hang on certainly no problem yes so sorry about that sorry what were you doing Oregon yes so so you know all that I want to be able to do for you today Lenny is you know just be able to put some numbers in front of you you know kind of let you know exactly how it would work you know the numbers of how many customers we'd be sending to you and you know how many of those are going to translate into sales for you and your business okay so you know Lenny just just give me one brief
