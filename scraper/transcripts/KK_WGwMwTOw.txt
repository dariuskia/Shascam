if it once or twice at a minimum it's going to save you 20 30 bucks okay sorry coming from again the name of our company is vacation play where the marketing arm for coral resort we actually have four resorts on Hilton Head and that speaks volumes for a 12 my 12 miles by 5 miles for us to have four resorts own such a little island now with that being said in exchange for your savings we do ask that you take a friendly ninety minute tour of our newest resort we treat you where we just want you to go home and tell your friends and family afterwards there's no obligations you've got a year to travel on the package yeah I am going to send you everything on riding the via email what is a good email address for you well you know here's a something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel C she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then did that happen but it bit that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or or phone call or whatever whatever it is right yeah now oh are you still there can you hear me oh yeah your sisters since you put it that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello yeah I'm here listening I'm here can you hear me okay sorry I have a have a bit of a a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is not so good yes sorry what were you saying again yeah let's get you locked in on the vacation and I can send you everything out not in via email you know how the opportunity of sitting down with your family going over all the information you guys would have one full year from today to travel on the package so let's go ahead and get you locked in we can put the $99 on Visa MasterCard American Express or Discover whichever you feel comfortable using well you know with the low finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how was this going through how is this going to work okay so let me make it make sense see especially if finances are a little tight this is actually a great way to travel you pay $99 today whenever you travel and do the 90 minute tour you actually are going to get that 99 dollars back with a $60 visa and a $40 gas rebate certificate so you're actually getting paid $1 to go on vacation so you know if funds are tight this definitely makes sense you know well are you that that does sound good I mean you have been very patient it's an old man here and it's yeah I mean it's something that that I've been told that I should be looking my third eldest Marissa or she I think I mentioned Laura sure before yes yes she she says that I should be going for the something like this but it's just a matter of what yeah what is most appropriate from the time and I guess she was not sick so I could just hang on for one second here hang on yes so sorry about but sorry okay so let me do something for you let me go ahead and add something in on the package now when you travel is it just you and your wife or to all the or to your children travel with you oh yes yes Oh someone someone did did say last
