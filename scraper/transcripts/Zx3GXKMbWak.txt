shopping or you pay bills online sometimes which countries are you calling from again oh yeah it's TSA Technical Support Assistants we are certified technicians on Microsoft's and windows ok well so every left is it was the last time so that someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have oh is it

with this phone and my hair okay no problem no problem yes sorry what were you saying again okay I am calling you from Technical Support Assistants okay there is a legitimate Mari with this what she works on Windows computers okay we are lazy to mid-body cain1 been in this business for more than like 25 years again and we are certified onward to work on Windows and Microsoft all right first thing and the second thing is every time your computer generates every report or any services on a computer does not respond or is it topped we get a report of it okay eventually we get a report of it and I say that internal security service on the computer that is windows management and windows remote management are not working on a computer Kay all right so do you know how to check the status well you know with the world finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how I was this going through how was this going to work okay okay let me tell you okay let me clear it for you okay I believe that you have some confusions in a mile okay no problem that should be okay first of all let me tell you this I mean we are going to check the status right now okay which will not cost you anything okay straight followed me are telling you which will not cost you anything after that if if more than five services are not working if more than five services are stopped then we have to diagnose okay which will not cost you anything okay diagnose is nothing but checking every reports on the computer and you will have your computer in front of you and I will guide you how to do that okay it's just bit of I mean it won't take more than 10 15 minutes or that's what we are gonna do okay and if it's--if is there any minor problems on the computer no problem sir I'll tell you how to fix it okay you you you can go ahead and you can fix that by yourself is if it's very minor okay and if it's major I'll tell you I'll suggest you what to do okay this is how it works fair enough any questions well that does sound good I mean you have been very patient all men here and never answered that my job yeah I mean it's something that but I think all that I should be looking at aha my third eldest where is she I think I mentioned Laura before yes yes she she says that I should go into something like this but system Amaral what you know what is most possible exactly and and and hang on one sec okay hang on sure iiiiii I guess those are ducks yes so sorry I guess I guess and the wrong no problem you have really cute you really have cute pitch I mean oh yes so much someone this should say last week there is some little coal ash looking at the time okay okay limit no no no that's that that's honest okay we we don't call so often okay unless we receive reports okay the moment we call you is only when we get report that's that's the one time they call us or else people call us for if they have any issues that's that's how it works again and the most important part is that if the services that there are few of very important services on the computer okay if they are not in a running status your computer is not protected it's not protected at all if it's not running in the computer okay that's that's that's the one that we need to check okay because it will not protect any personal data or personal information of yours if you have in the computer okay that's that's the most important thing that's that I wanted to tell you okay no problem sir let's do this if you are in front of the computer you can check the status okay so do you mind getting on the computer sorry what's your name again yeah it's Robert well it's funny but you should call because my third Elvis Larissa ah ha she was talking about this just this last week and you know everything she's she is very smart I'll give her mad because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and ha ha ha with distinction no they're all quite bad so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into this sort of claim so what more can you tell me about it oh sure I can I can tell you well if you have any questions you can ask me if friendly because unless and until you know we diagnose the computer I won't be able to tell you anything about the technical stuffs because it's not you know quite easy to understand ok it's only when I take you through the process then only we you'll get to understand ok there's other things happening on my computer ok that's that's how it works so if you have any questions of course here I am you can ask any question you'd be on us any any question regarding the computer I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it because she's able also again ok listen if you have any questions you can go ahead and ask me any questions regarding your computer regarding the system regarding these services again so and I won't be able to you know tell you or like this I mean I have to take you through the computer to show what's happening with the computer and what the services are that I was talking about which is not in running status so I have to take you through that I have to show you in order to understand ok that's how it works sorry again I'm sorry I are you not able to listen hello would you show again McGinnis ok let's let's take it like this again you have the computer in front of you yes yes ok do

ok certified technicians I'm a senior technician on the floor ok and we get reports whenever things go wrong with the computer or services turned off on the computer ok that's how we get reports and we call up our customers and we say that and we ask them to check the status ok so if you are in front of the computer I will show you where the services are and I will show you how to check them ok well fair enough here's a something because the last time someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have they shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel C C wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens but it's--but that really hurt and and and sometimes in

sort of thing um so what more can you tell me about it well yeah it's a simple thing is that the problem what do you have on a computer is basically only with the internal services which is stopped working but we don't know what else we do so not running okay that can be many other reasons maybe there can be a virus which is not allowing to work this internal services there's only something which we can only check and then I can let you know I'm sorry I didn't quite catch exactly a she-devil but again yeah it's like only I can only let you know what what exactly the problem is once I have a check on it this sorry wave again so just hold on would you say that again again please hello hello yes what's up getting yummy now yes isn't it sorry sorry what what were you saying again see I'm just trying to explain you now the problem what you have on a computer it's like in timebomb you can say okay now this kind of problems come with a time setting for an example if we waste our time and if we go for more than one week or maybe go for two weeks there is always the possibility okay that your your computer can go to a crash mode okay because the services which are not working on a computer they are one of the very very very star very important services and that should be running 24 by 7 but they are stopped what did you do with your computer tell me sir what exactly you do on a computer if if what do you do on a computer sorry which company are you calling from again I'm calling you from TSA well you know here's a something because the last time that someone called up and
