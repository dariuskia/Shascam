more can you tell me about it about the services we offer well um we do offer a cable television and phone packages on top of our internet and by packaging deals together with us you're actually able to save money on your current bill assuming you've been with our internet for over a year how that works is um a lot two out of the three of our services our cable and internet they start at a promotional rate just to get you as a better deal in savings for the first year afterwards they wrote back twenty dollars which isn't you know too terribly much but um basically uh when you sign up for our internet while already having I'm sorry our cable while already having our internet if you've been with us it'll roll back that price and you get a promo on the cable so a little bit more specifically about the packages if you're interested sir we do offer three different types of cable TV packages and one competitive lee rated home phone that is 99.9 percent reliable and as all sorts of really interesting features that still build value even if you have a cell phone so if either of these peaks your interest of you won't hear a little more about our cable packages i'm sorry i couldn't quite catch it catch you label whole set again Oh would you like to hear more about a cable TV packages sir but the sorry again while i was asking sir would you like to hear more about our cable TV packages would you say that again again please yes sir i was wondering if you would like to hear more about our cable TV packages yes it's awesome so we offer three different packages like I said and the first one is our spectrum of standard and how about how that one it goes is um it starts at thirty nine ninety-nine a month and in the first year and then the second year goes back to 59 99 it offers you 125 channels depending on your area it can be more and our spectrum silver package comes with 3 premium channels HBO cinemax and Showtime and it comes with digital one which that is a special channel package that we offer that provides you with 45 different kids and educational programs that ones generally like either you know for family or for people that are consistently interested in documentaries and learning like I always liked learning so you know I'm on like discovery channel and National Geographic all the time so that's a really good package and it's actually the best value for your money and then we offer our gold package it was just for people who really really enjoy television and that one starts out of let's see 7999 a month and but that includes all of the premium channels that we currently have subscriptions with HBO Cinemax Showtime TMC stars encore and epics and it gives you digital one and two and digit tier 2 includes all of our sports programming as well now again like I said that's for like someone who's really really interested in Catholic television if you're just looking for the basic programming i do recommend our spectrum select which is our basic package you have any questions so far sir sorry of which company did you say you're calling from again charter communications sir well you know here's here's the thing because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I gotten quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I feel were my eldest Rachel she see wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know that that happens you know but it's bit that really hurt and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or phone call or what what what ever it is absolutely sir I understand my bad you can continue I'm sorry oh yeah scissors since you you pull up that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello I do try my best to thank you well absolutely yes sir I'm still with you any emmys sorry this is I have a have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is also good oh yeah it's okay sorry what were you saying again um well well we were talking about our cable services sir and then you were letting me know about your family and a couple other things were you still interested in learning more about our services sir well you know with the low finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how how was this guy through how is this going to book well so we could eat a sign you up with cable or are we could get you a cable and home phone just depending on your needs I mean do you guys currently have a cable provider in the home well are you said that does sound good i mean you have been very patient it's an old man here and is yeah I mean it's something that but I've been told that I should be looking at my third eldest Marissa or she I think I mentioned or should be fork is yes he gave me she says that though that I should be going for something like this but it's just a matter of what you know what is most appropriate from the time of cornish so I could you just hang on for one second here hang on absolutely all those ducks huh that's cool yes so sorry about but oh oh it's okay sorry what were you saying arrogant well as a matter of fact sir are based on what it sounds like would be best for you is a budget cable package where you can get a lot of diverse programming while also not paying to super much for it so what we could do is we could set you up with our spectrum select package which is our basic channel set up but it comes with over 125 channels and I'm sure you'll find a lot of programs that you'll enjoy on it we could also set you up with a home phone which is only nineteen ninety-nine a month and what that is uh that actually comes with a lot of really cool features one of them's an emergency response service so when you put your address in when you sign up for this phone you are able to dial 911 in the event of an emergency and they already have your address before you even tell them it's a really cool little feature just in the event of anything going wrong and it also comes with 27 calling and blocking features which you can control online so what we could do is we could package those together and you'll actually be getting the most value for your money through that how it would work is in the first year for all three of these services now this is a really competitive rate keep in mind oh one more thing sir how many TVs do you currently have in your home is this someone someone did kids say last week that is someone did koloff's week about the same thing what was recession you knowledge there was a way it wasn't me yes
