yes yes okay um if you um if you are spending one hundred dollars for your electricity bill each month and you qualify for both of our programs one is called a hero program in the other one is called Hyuna first our hero program does deal with alternative energy solar and if you don't like the idea of having solar panels on your roof we actually specialize in what is called ground mounts or so we could even solve your panels in the back in your backyard it feeling like the way it looks oh yes we also so what someone did did say last week though did someone did call us week about the same thing
