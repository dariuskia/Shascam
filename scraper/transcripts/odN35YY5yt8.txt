from bondage business solutions how are you oh sorry I [ __ ] barely hear you this oh he'll only speak up can you hear me better now good this is you can't okay so we're provider of hosted voice over IP phone service are you familiar with what that is oh good if you are ok so it's phone service that's channeled through the internet rather than over traditional copper lines and so usually you know since we do it through the internet we can save you money and we can definitely also offer more features than your traditional copper line phone service so I wanted to ask just a few questions about your current phone service to see if we could offer something cheaper maybe something that would better suit your needs so I know you're probably busy let me just expedite this sir are you what is your name Lenny oh yes yes someone someone did say last week that someone did call offs week about the same thing what was it was that you know it wasn't me I'm actually I'm looking at your file right here it says somebody tried last week and they got your voicemail so if you talk to somebody from a phone company last week it most likely wasn't from bondage if it was from bondage they didn't disposition it so so basically I just what what's your name again jack well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest Larissa she she was talking about this just this last week and you know she she's well she is very smart I will give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know and we're all quite proud of her yes yes so I'm right yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it okay so voice over IP phone service is as simple as you know it's description is it's phone service that's routed through the internet now the hosted part that we offer makes it better because when you subscribe to us you don't have to lease and you don't have to buy a huge piece of technology that you keep in a phone cabinet all you have to do is purchase the IP phones by the monthly service there's no contract and our phone since it doesn't have that technology that it needs to be able to route the calls the calls go straight to our data center and then they're then routed to the recipient of the phone call so it's a lot more convenient ends up being cheaper means you know there there's scalability with it so I mean if you have two phones and you want to upgrade to ten phones you don't have to spend thousands of dollars on a new piece of equipment you just have to buy the new phones pay you know upgrade to the new amount of lines being paid for and so it's easily scaled in that way now it's also a lot better what cut it cut sure they will pull it again okay so it's also a lot more convenient because it integrates with CRM so you know the clients that you have when you bring up their profile when you get a call or when you call those clients their profiles are automatically displayed on the screen assuming that the software is able to be integrated which it most usually is so it's just it's easier being able to contact clients and being able to you know receive calls from clients having that information on the screen you know a lot of times if you get a call from someone and you know you have them you have the phone in one hand and then the other hand you're trying to you know look up information type information the computer whatnot it just makes it kind of difficult especially when you're multitasking you know even with things that you're doing before the call so I mean just the whole process of having the voice over IP integrating with you know the internet and in the CRM s makes it a lot more palpable to you know your average business person these days now I'm actually not the expert on all this stuff there are consultants that are standing by it can address more specific needs what I wanted to do is ask a few basic questions about your business and the way that your phone is currently set up including your provider and the details you know you're just the length of the contract and see if we could help you and if it turns out that we could provide better service you know something that would be more convenient for you then I can transfer you right over to a consultant they can give you a price quote and then you'd go ahead and you'd upgrade to our system and there'd be a net benefit for yourself so let me just get started here how many phones how many phone lines do you currently have in your business but the litter sorry again how many phone lines do you have would you say that again again please sure how many are the whole description that I gave you or just my question if ish okay how many phone lines do you have in your business sorry which company did you say you're calling from again vonage business solutions well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got in quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have we shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know that that happens you know but did that really hurt and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or or phone call or whatever whatever it is right okay so who does make the decisions about your your phone options well yeah scissors since you pull up that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here right hello all right that's opponents are you there I'm here can you him it oh yes sorry sorry what what we strike again okay so basically what I was trying to do here is ask you a couple things about your current business and and in your phone system and I do appreciate your patience here working with me I'm slightly new so you know I'm not getting everything right here off the bat so you know this is good practice for me and so I just wanted to ask a few things and so so what I'm not trying to do is I'm not trying to get your money right now I just want to ask you some questions see if we could you know see if we'd be better than your current phone provider which I will find a way for our service to be and then what I can do is transfer you to a sales consultant the sales consultant what he will do is he'll tell you the price that our service will work out to and and so he'll give you a quote and so you'll have that quote and you can use that you know for reference when you're deciding on you know which provider you want to go with and so forth so you know if you happen to know these details you know it would be beneficial let's see do you do you know how many lines you have how many phones or how many phone lines are in the office well you know with the low finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how I was this going true how was this going to work how's it going - what well you said that does sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here it's something that that I've told what I should be looking at my third oldest were Irish Marissa or she I think I mentioned Laura before yes yes she she says that that I should be going for something like this you know but what is most important for the time and I guess one last thing so I could you just hang on for one second here hang on okay yes sir sorry about that oh it's only chance we got a mariner sounds like you might have had a couple ducks back there quacking in the background there well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest Marissa she she was talking about this just this last week and yeah I see she's well she is very smart I'll give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and seeing all right with distinctions you know where we're all quite about her yes so she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it okay so there are a lot of features that we offer that are just included with the standard package whereas an analog you would have to pay extra for each feature for example I believe a lot of analog phone providers charge extra for call forwarding so for example if somebody was calling your office and you happen to not be in your office and you wanted to get those calls you'd be able to set the option on your computer for the system to automatically forward the call to your cell phone okay that's something that it's very convenient I believe it's kind of tricky for analog service to do that but you know with the computer in the internet you can just easily forward the call to the extension at your home another thing is that our phones like I said since they're hosted you're able to bring your phone from place to place you bring your phone from the office you can bring your phone home which you might think well why the heck would I want to bring my phone home well if you live in the Northeast US like I do you know there tend to be snow storms on occasion and you know when you go home one night you're not sure if you're going to go back the next morning because you know there could be ice and everything on the road so you're the employees can just go ahead and take the phones home and work from home and they wouldn't have to set anything up on the computer when they plug it into the computer the phone automatically contacts our servers and downloads the required software for to be automatically put to use all right you know there are other features as well see if you are for example ok this company of yours is called consulting correct so I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it because sure they will pull this out again so so with your company consulting what you'd be able to do is integrate your CRM software so the software you know that your clients are using and that you're using to to track your clients and and when you get a call you just automatically see their profile right but you know I already explained that but there are other apps that you can use if your CRM is not integratable for example there's a gene google map where if somebody is calling you their profile pops up and search results for their name on the Google search bar automatically upon calling so you kind of can get a feel for if they do have any profiles from the Google search of you know the kind of prospective client you'd be dealing with we have a feature called follow me which basically entails you not having to ever miss a call right so if you don't happen to be in the office you know you might be in your office you might be at home you know you might be at a client you know with just your cell phone when somebody contacts you it will bring a certain amount of rings however many you choose at your office and then and then on your cell phone and then maybe at your home phone so you can be sure that you know if they're important calls coming and you know a client's potential business is on the line you can make sure that the call won't be missed right because how annoying is it if you want to you know be a client of a business or you want to inquire about the services of a business when you try to call a business and all you get is voicemail you know leave a message after the tone what our service allows is for the basic price pretty much the price of a residential phone system you can have a completely professional outlook to your client base right so even if somebody calls at 3 o'clock in the morning they say hey oh I feel like I want to you know check out this business see what's going on well they check out maybe your website is called 24/7 right so they can call and then it says it gives them information there are prompts you know to leave a message push one if you'd like you know more information about this service push to you know if this is an immersion see push three and we'll transfer you over to maybe some guy that's on call right so so for the price of just a standard phone system you're able to get a whole professional suite which actually includes upwards of 42 free features you know that I actually I have a list of here in front of me but the fact is that you know that voice over IP phone systems are pretty much taking over the industry you know digital is going to be the future you know for phone systems and communication in general so if you get on the bandwagon now you know you're going to have the knowledge for for you know the when the years to come when there's going to be an overall transfer you know from copper to voice over IP systems okay now we have just the standard features that your your standard analog phone will have right you know call queue somebody if you're currently on the phone and somebody calls you they're not going to get a busy signal they're going to get a prompt command and they're going to be sitting in what's called a call queue and and there'll be a voice on the call queue up your caller number for your estimated wait time is three minutes right so you have these professionalized features you know if you call Comcast and you want to set something like this up they're going to say all right well here's your basic phone package well for X number of dollars you can get call waiting for X number of dollars you can get call forwarding you know and they're going to just kind of load it on right and it's most likely going to be a lot more expensive than what we do because what we do is just written right into code right so so it's just it's a wonderful service to be able to you know have and and really get in before it really blows up and everybody has this service right so so let me just ask you sir so you're still there on the line and haven't heard you there how many so you have 12 phones in your office or see if is the oh here I'm sorry again how many phone lines do you have in your office would you show that again again please sure how many phone lines do you have in your office yes yes yes right so you have maybe five or so you're calling from again advantage hello you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I hadn't quite a bit of trouble from the people here because it went for something that I shouldn't have they should be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then wow that happens you know but did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or or phone call or whatever it is yep I understand okay so maybe you shouldn't be the one to go forward and end up purchasing the service is what you're saying oh yeah scissors since you pull up that way I mean you you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello yep I'm here hello are you there how much it would cost you to break yes sorry sorry what were you saying again [Music] automated system with the world finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how it was this guy true how was this going to book okay right now I'm talking to it but it does sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here it's something Col what I should be she says going for something like this you know but what is most appropriate from the time and I guess you are not
