week now you know then that happens you know but it bit really good one that I'm not all that family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any job or or

what were you saying there again I was trying to give you an example of exactly what we're talking about let's say you're from vacation in another city where you know you're just vacationing there and you get a flat tire what do you think you're going to do while you're on the side of the road is this someone someone did kids say last week no did someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you I'm not sure I don't I don't believe it was alright pumping like I said there's a lot of people who are probably calling you but all those people aren't real certified partners then insurer charging month and month they're gonna promise you the first page of Google and that's not what we do all we want to do is basically get you set up correctly so your customers your existing customers can find you but more importantly potential customers that you're missing out on because let's face it Yellow Pages is outdated about you but if I'm looking for a restaurant or I need a handyman I go on Google I type it in I see what reviews are listed and I decide who I'm going to do business with very soft that you know I mean I understand where my mouth is also helpful but even if it's word of mouth and you get recommended you know your buddy says hey you did a good job for me here give them a call don't you want that person be able to google your name or booboo your company and see that your legitimate company before they even come meet you it just kind of allows you to see more professor on in 2016 so that's the way the customers are going to find you if you if you want that new business does that make her sorry what's your name again my name is Alex a LAX Josif Jo se th well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and you know she's no she is very smart I'll give her that because you know she was in the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know we're we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yes she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it come see here and what are the services that you provide I don't think we got to go over that I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you they will pour sorry what are you guys specializing one of the services that you guys provide but the sorry again the the services you provide what is your company specializing would you say that again again please I said what what I'm services what services what type of work II that I specialize it yes yes hmm sorry which company did you say you're calling from again Anson media well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel C she would wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it bit that really regiment sometimes and that means unless these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or or phone call or or or what whatever it is hmm I'm trying to explain you the service it is something that you'd be interested in or is it over your head at this point well yeah since you've pulled up that way I mean you've been quite friendly straightforward with you here yeah I mean it's hoping that it's 2016 you know any closer you look you need to grow if you want your customers feel I knew sorry the first point I have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing it's not so good yes oh sorry what were you saying again really trying to explain to you the value of what we're trying to help you with if it's not something that you see is beneficial to you it was just hard for me to believe that's why I mean you can you can you can tonight we're just trying to help you once your google listing to optimize you're basically guaranteed to add more calls have more customers be able to find you but again you haven't even explained to me what services or products that you provide so it's hard for me to explain more until you do that well you know with the world finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were and no issue I was asked Eichenberg it's simply a registration sir so there's no monthly fees there's no annual fees it's not it's not a marketing campaign per se this is basically just what you need to do first and foremost if you want to have any type of relevancy on the internet well yeah I will lose my mind over sin entirely good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here and it's yeah I mean it's something that that I've been told that I should be looking at or one time she only a one time invention before yes yes iam one time in Fishers that that I should be going for the nothing like this because just a man is that hope we bought you know what is most innocent and I was going to be careful because it sorry there's the word that hang on for one second fit hang on yes so sorry about that sorry what were you saying there again I was a child you know I mean this is this is the first step I got in saying you having any relevancy on the Internet now what we're talking here isn't an annual payment it's not a monthly payment okay for a one-time payment of $499 not only do you get your listing up youõll we also make your company a private Facebook so you guys can grow on Facebook and we also put together a YouTube video for you I don't know if you know but Google actually owns YouTube are you aware that oh yes yes someone someone did kids say last week though did someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you no now's not me yes sorry what was your name again my name is Alex well it's value that you should call because my third eldest Larissa she was talking about this just this last week and you know you know she is very smart I'll give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing yeah so well no a small thing it what's that why don't we get the application going and see what categories you'd be fitting in okay I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it because you they will what was that again I said that's where I hadn't get the application started to interview with categories you guys Finch okay but the sorry again I said why don't we go ahead and get the application started so we can kind of take a look at it and walk you through exactly what we'll be doing for you exactly okay could you say that again like in please basically I just want to go over what I'm talking to you about okay obviously your daughter said that is something you I get into that's because it's a single most important way that you can market your business in 2016 if that's not something that you understand I can respect that okay but I seem to just be going around the bush at this point I'm just trying to do my job and help you out if it's not something that you think is plausible for you it's hard for me to believe I don't want to waste either of our times okay if if but it only takes about 5 to 10 minutes like I said for a one-time fee of only 499 dollars you get your Google listing taken care of you get a business Facebook and we put together a YouTube video for you to attach to all three of those miniature site sorry which company did you say you're calling from again jumping media hello you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up one discerns spoke to me or me on the phone I could be blunt little answer from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have probably shouldn't be this present yes I think my eldest Rachel see she doesn't speak to me for all you be putting this on a personal or business card day you know but that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or or phone call or or whatever is your home by chance or any of your children home by chance oh yeah scissors since you you pull it that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello yeah hello are you there yep oh yes sorry
