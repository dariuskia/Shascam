I'm calling because we are currently selecting homeowners in your area we're willing to display a small sign of her company and in exchange for the publicity you provide us we would like to offer you a free wireless security system with $1,500 activation fees would all be included and your system would be connected to a DTS monitoring center and for only a dollar 33 a day the service will protect you against any burglaries home invasion medical emergencies and also from a fire and it's definitely not a decision we want you to make over the phone mr. that's why there is a security advisor in your area tomorrow he's paid by the company so it would be absolutely free he can meet with you explain the promotion in detail and of course answer all your questions and after that you would have a better idea if this promotion would be suited for you it would only take about 15 minutes of your time and it is a free appointment so when would be a convenient time for you tomorrow i have an opening at one or would you like something maybe a little bit later around four o'clock is this someone someone did kids say last week no did someone did call us week about the same thing what was it was that you I don't think so while we're just for a limited time in the area with this promotion and we already have appointments over there so we're just giving everybody a chance to get in on the system on the girl yes sorry what's your name again my name's Stefan so while it is it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and you know she's no she is very smart I'll give her bad because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all wonderful that is very good so I'm sure she was saying that I should look you know get into this into systems or something for you so what more can you tell me about it that's why we have a security advisor I'm just the promotion's Department and I'm making the appointments for him so that's why he is free he can come like I said meet with you he would explain everything to you you can ask him anything you like and that way you get informed on the system and how it works and everything the only thing I can tell you it's the latest system in the market and it's the fastest for real a time like if there's ever an emergency would call the first available vehicle and everything you don't have to go through any operators so that is very good especially if you're alone and all that so it is a free appointment why don't you just take it and he can explain everything to you in the end it's always your decision if you're not interested with what is today showing you he just moves on to the next appointment
