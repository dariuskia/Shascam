bill that you get from the exact same people only thing is we're just going to get it at a lower rate [Music] [Applause] worth [Music] the only thing that's going to happen is Oh skinny the only thing that's going to happen is on or about the next time your bill comes out to read your meter or if they do it electronically they're going to draft up your next bill and your utility company is going to take the higher rate off of your bill and put the lower rate that we establish today on there for you and you just continue to pay the same people the same way you've been doing it just like you do
