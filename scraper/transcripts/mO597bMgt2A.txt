she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know gobble or phone call or whatever whatever it is okay so um the call is regarding sort of Medicare supplemental you you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello well yes I am like yes I'm here sir David this callers in regards to Medicare czar for ministers I'm helping you the telephone is breaking out of them can you hear me now I'm so good yes sorry what were you saying again well the reason for my call today is that we were calling a regarding Medicare supplement all right 65 are turning 65 well you know it whips alone answers the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how was this guy true how is this going to bug well how it worked or is it the Medicare supplement covers your the part that Medicare doesn't cover like you have two different parts for Medicare which is your a and your B your a covers hospital only your B covers doctor's office visits and everything else so on each side of the plan side a there's a deductible side B there's a separate another deductible and on side a which is hospitalization you have to meet that one thousand three hundred and sixteen dollar deductible per incident and that's how much your deductible is for your Part A it also comes with a coinsurance here at Part A as well as your Part B the 80/20 coinsurance split so the two invoice learn from you you know having a medical bill Connecticut because Medicare doesn't cover everything 100% that we are for a supplement and the supplement will cover what Medicare doesn't cover such as your 20% and it will cover the deductible for your part one I'm sorry Part A 1516 dollars it will also cover the deductible on the other side of which is Part B and you don't have to be responsible for any of your medical bills for entire year once you get a medical supplement in place do you understand sir well that that does sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here and yeah I mean it's something that but I've been told that I should be looking at my third oldest were Laura she I think I mentioned Laura before yes yes she's a human I mean earlier Marissa I should gone to something like this but it's just a matter of what you know what what is most puggly from the the time and I guess what not so I could just hang on for one second here hang on yes so sorry about but what were your surrogate I was basically going over the Medicare and how it actually the supplement actually work with your Medicare your normal traditional Medicare your party and your Part B and how the supplement would cover everything at a hundred percent there are two different types of supplements of course one is a plan G the other is a plan F about both plans cover you at a hundred percent the plan G has an annual deductible of one hundred and eighty five dollars once you meet that then they cover you at a hundred percent for all your medical bills because you with Medicare there is some gap and that's what your supplement is going to do cover the gap that one hundred percent is someone someone did did fight last week that is someone that koloff's week about the same thing what was it was that we did probably call because we call it with trial follow up with you and keep calling you so that you won't go outside of your open enrollment period once you go outside of the open enrollment period they can possibly penalize you they could possibly rate you up and say you know they can also do underwriting process where are allowed to go and check your medical records and see if you've been diagnosed with anything within the past twelve months so they want you to do it Medicare want you to sign up with with your supplement like within your open enrollment period they don't want you to do an after-the-fact what is your birthday let me verify your birthday when is your birthday again sorry show name again my name is Nicole Williams well it's funny that you should call
