Lennon this is Melissa region I what safe streets ADT how are you doing today oh good yes yes yes well I was calling because ADT they were doing a promotion for all one of them my Hatton and they selected your resident for our system that we are introducing this month have you received the courtesy call on behalf of adt or is this the first time you be another five is someone someone kids say last week no did someone did call us week about the same thing what was it was that you it might have been someone from the promotional division with adt it wasn't me it's my first time contacting but did you guys what you guys interested in the system that they're giving you for your home yes sorry what's your name again this is melissa with safe streets adt that does home security for residents alike medical emergencies fires and break-ins well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was not talking about this just this last week and you know sceles know she is very smart i'll give about because you know she's missing first in the family to go to university and see how can it distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so yes she was saying that i should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about us and for the system that they are giving you is the one that we are introducing is our new 2015 wireless system it is designed for any type of break in for them not to be successful as an intruder or a person that's looking to break in your home they're giving you all of the quick everything is Wireless which means you don't have a lot of drilling done in your home so everything is nicely in me and you don't have any wires on the outside of your home which means no one can clip a wire on the outside of the home to break in without the system going off all right the system will include the LCD keypad and that's the push-button keep that it goes on the wall for police fire and paramedics we can't take all door so any way someone can break in from the outside of your home inside see contact so that door will say found that signal will go off they also cover your windows so if someone is thinking to climb through a window they will go ahead and have the infrared motion detector to cover the window salads alarm 72-hour backup battery window stickers as well as the lawn sign you also receive your siren which is 85 decimal points so that's about to found the two fire trucks put together it's very loud then you get your wireless key remote so you're able to activate as well as deactivate that system a thousand feet from your home so if you are pulling in the driveway in your hands are tied with groceries a hell bags in your hand you can simply deactivate that alarm systems gotta press of a button now on that key remote you also go and get the medical pendant as well are you familiar with Life Alert I've seen the commercial with the old lady following and saying to help help i'm following I can't get up I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you they will pull us out again I was askin do you remember the commercial remember seeing a commercial from life alert what the older lady fallen in saying to help help I'm falling I can't get up it was a commercial for Life Alert so if you fail in your home you just hit the medical pendant and you're automatically connected to the paramedics I was a commercial that they would have air it was living on the air again that commercial was Life Alert it's been on the air for bowel maybe about 15 20 years but the reason for me saying that they give you one of those pendants it's the only life or a key fob that you can use for any medical emergencies so you can program it for just the paramedics so anytime something happens to you in your home and no one else is there with you you can simply hit that panic button and you're connected to the paramedics okay so you will receive that and then they also give you your discount so save up to twenty percent off your homeowners insurance you will get the lifetime service agreement and you're going to save up to five hundred dollars deductible all right so they give you 2 for 9 yards and that is only on the basic system so everything I just mentioned to you is what you're going to receive on a basic system could you say that again again please everything that I just mentioned to you is what you're going to receive on a basic system so that's like our lowest package that we have but you get so much with just a basic system for your resident so you're going to receive that you discount your lifetime service agreement and saving up to twenty percent off your premium yes yes yes ok and that's all I'm on that basic so you you qualify for it no matter what system you go with your they're going to waive all equipment as well as your installation off so it definitely benefits you to take advantage of the promotion out cuz I rather you pay nothing now you have to pay something later on since we did select your home sorry how which company did you show you calling from again I'm calling with faith streets ADT you know that they are delicious thing that's the last time that I'd someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got in quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these are these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job off or phone call or or what for whatever it is and of course yeah so like what these calls that were given you because you were selected is the reason why we're contacting you now you are selected through your phone provider because of your landline that you just had placed in the home here in Manhattan they just felt like you were good candidates system so we're giving you everything that we're promoting that's the reason I am giving you a call today okay now with any of your kids or anything of that nature definitely is having a home security system or something you guys talked about I would definitely love to go ahead and put everything into the system get you set up I will want your children there you know what if it's Rachel or whoever to be there with you why the technician is there that way they can go over everything with you okay and they can be there they can ask questions all of their questions can get answered just like your questions all right oh it would any of your kids be available today to come over you sisters since you flip that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here ya know yes I'm here what's yes hello are you there yes yes I'm you can hear me oh yes sorry this is I have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is not so good yes sorry what were you saying again yeah i was saying i can actually have someone if any of your kids can be there with you today I can't someone out because we selected 15 homes to receive the system so i have technicians already in your area for Manhattan so I can have someone come out there they can sit with you they don't have to do anything yet they could sit with you that could talk with you you and your any of your kids your daughter if you choose if you want it to have right to their I will prefer someone to be there with you and that way they can ask any questions and get all of their questions answered as well and if this is a good fit for you and your family then you can definitely go through with it my technician will be prepared to have everything install for you well you know with the world finances the way there I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how I was just going through how was a skunk book okay basically what they do is come out they evaluate your home they look at it they map it out and say this is where your keypad should go where your motion detected a coat should go and then they install the system out there having your input in anyone else's input that matters to you in the home once they do that they activate your system they register your address to the local authorities in Manhattan so if someone tries to break in your home if you have a fire or even a medical emergency they know exactly went home to go to so they register your address once they activate that system that technician is well on his way and then you just pay the monthly monetary on the system and that's just to keep it on in that gift so if you go like I said our basic system you can do our basic system and just pay the monthly monitoring rate on the basic system but if you're interested in cameras or things like that like if your kids I don't know how close you are with your children your children can actually get a pull system with adt and they can put cameras in the home and they can actually check on you to make sure you're okay if that's something that they want to do so if they're on vacation or live in another city or state then they can definitely just check in on you to make sure you're okay all right and you can do the same thing vice versa you can log on to your computer if you have a computer or electronic device if you have an electronic device like a smartphone or iphone and you can see exactly what's going on in your home without even be in at home
