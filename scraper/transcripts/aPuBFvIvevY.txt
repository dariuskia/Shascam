hey there sir how are you doing today uh sorry i i can barely hear you there oh okay i apologize um what about now sir that's a little bit better yes yes oh okay sir my name is clark hazley and i'm an energy advisor folding from agr on behalf of direct energy competitive retailers here in alberta now the reason for the phone call was to tell you about the simple three dual fuel plant that direct energy has available which will protect you from fluctuating regulated rates and the plan also comes with the benefit of a one-time free furnace maintenance as well now your name appears on either bill electric or gas oh good yes yes okay great now for quality assurance purposes we do record the phone calls is that okay with you oh yes yes uh someone someone did did say last week that someone did call last week about the same thing was was that you well it probably was one of the representatives from our office or it could have been another whole different company but direct energy we're one of north america's largest service providers we serve more competitive retailers than anybody else in the continent now one thing i want to ask you sir are you familiar with your gas and electric choice options that you have sorry what was your name again oh i apologize sir my name is clark hazley well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa she she was talking about this uh just just last week and you know she's she is very smart i'll give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and see past with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that i should uh look you know get into the look into this sort of thing um so what more can you tell me about us and and that's a great question sir because first of all let me let you know direct energy sir there are never any fees to enroll with our plans that we have available for you nor are there cancellation fees okay but this is something that you are qualified for because you have the right to choose how you buy your gas in electricity now your utility companies will not change um you probably have atko and fortis uh you're in the pinochet area uh i'm sorry i don't really quite catch you they did catch you there well hold on again okay you're in the area in which right now you probably still have this utilities uh you have atco for your gas utility and ford is for the electric utility okay right now sorry again and let me ask you this way sir are you receiving a pink bill from direct energy regulated services for your gas could you show that again again please yes sir yes sir yes sir i can uh are you getting a pink bill from direct energy regulated services for your gas ish yes okay great now are you with f core for the electric sorry uh which company did you show you recalling from again i'm phoning from direct energy competitive energy retail providers here in alberta and what i want to do is i want to make sure that you understand everything about the choice program because i know there's a lot of questions that you want to ask okay and i'ma place my manager on the phone his name is david roberts and he's going to help you out and help you understand the whole entire program okay so just hold the line for me one second okay well you know here's the thing because the last time that someone called up uh and spoke to me uh on the phone i got in quite a bit of trouble from the people here because i went for something that i shouldn't have i probably shouldn't be telling you that but um yes i think my my eldest rachel she she uh uh wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know that that happens you know but uh that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than uh any you know job or phone call or what whatever it is hi okay i'm sorry about that okay so the agent said that you had some questions about um well yeah since since you pulled it that way i mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello yes i'm still here with you hello are you there yes i'm still with you can you hear me oh yes sorry this is i have a bit of a problem with this phone and and my hearing is it's not so good um yes sorry what were you saying again okay the agent said he was having a hard time hearing you so i wanted to see if i can get on here and explain the program to you well you know with the world finances the way they are i know you know we're not we're not allowed to spend as much as as what we were or how how how how was this going through how is this going to work okay what this does is this protects you from the wraith fluctuating well that that does sound good i mean you have been very patient with an old man here it's something that that i've been told that i should be looking at uh um my third eldest lord loretha she uh i think i mentioned larissa before yes yes she um she says uh that that i should be going for something like this you know what what is most appropriate for for uh the time and i guess whatnot sorry could you just hang on for one second here hang on sure go ahead go ahead yeah so sorry about that um sorry what were you saying we've known each other for so long we know don't tell me never gonna let you down thank you on behalf
