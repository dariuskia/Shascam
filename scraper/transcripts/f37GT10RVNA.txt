speak to mr. missus please hello this is Lenny oh yes thank you my name is Carl and I'm calling from HVAC services we're a local heating and air conditioning company and we're just calling Claire sorry I'm [ __ ] barely hear you there oh yes is this mister yes yes ish oh thank you sir my name is Carl and I'm calling from HVAC services a we're heating and air conditioning company and we're just calling quickly to inquire about the status of your annual safety inspection and system tune-up for your home's furnace and air conditioner do you know if when you last had that kind of maintenance work done on your system oh good yes yes yes okay this is something that manufacturers usually recommend that you have done annually do you know what it was less completed by chance is someone someone did kids say last week that is someone did koloff's week about the same thing what was it was that you I couldn't say I there are any number of companies in the business and as the weather has gotten warmer you're probably receiving calls from any number of companies since a lot of people do this kind of work this maintenance and safety inspection either right before the heating season or right before the cooling season and of course it's starting to get a little warmer out but we are running a very attractive promotional special right now which includes the factory tune-up a safety inspection and this time we're also tossing in a whole house air duct cleaning as well and that's all for a flat fee of sixty-five dollars normally I'm sorry what's your name again and my name is Carl sir well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and you know she she's no she is very smart I'll give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed there's a sanctions I know where we're all quite proud of her yes so I hear she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it oh well I'd be happy to what this entails is well like I can give you a point-by-point description of what the tune-up and safety inspection entail they check the indoor coil of the air conditioner because if they become coated in dust it'll still operate but it will be less efficient which means you'll be using more electricity they check the refrigerant pressures and temperatures they check the gun Armour sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you later what was that again oh yes at the second point was they checked the pressure and temperature of the air conditioners refrigerant to make sure that's operating as coolly as it can they check the drain line of the air conditioner for proper drainage pitch because all air conditioners generate a large amount of condenses water and if that's not drained away efficiently it will start to pool and it can start to breed mold and mildew they check for refrigerant leaks they took your thermostat and if it needs to be recalibrated they will do that so that the temperature is reflected accurately or as accurately as possible so if you put it on 72 it'll be as close to 72 in your home as it can be if you look at the large outdoor coil that it's usually got a very large fan it's usually on the ground on the house you've probably noticed that they're oftentimes covered in leaves and grass clippings and things so bill they'll clean that coil the outdoor coil which is the part of your conditioner that releases the heat and again it operates if it's covered in debris but it just uses up more electricity and because it's operating much less efficiently they also replace the standard filters which we supply as part of the $65 package and I'm then on the furnace side the unit they'll monitor and adjust the natural gas pressure they check the system to ensure there are no carbon monoxide leaks when the furnace is running on both side the people is sorry again yes of course oh yes they checked in natural gas pressure and they'll adjust that if it needs to be and then they also check the system the furnace side of the system for carbon monoxide leaks because of course from the natural gas burns it does produce carbon monoxide as as a by-product and you want to be sure that that's not inadvertently leaking into the vent work and coming into the home they check all of the electrical connectors and relays just to make sure that they're all tight and that those are running efficiently they check the any belts in the system connecting the motors to blowers and this sort of thing to make sure none are glazed or cracked or slipping they check the heat exchanger in your furnace for any cracks again to keep carbon monoxide out of the home and to make sure that it's running as efficiently as possible and therefore is cheaply going to show that again again please oh yeah it's a it's a part of the furnace that's called a heat exchanger and that's essentially the large metal part inside the furnace that it heats up from the gas flames the exhaust from the gas is then vented to the outside but the heat exchanger the fan blows across that and that's what puts the heat into the house it's essentially a large iron radiator of sorts and if it gets cracked or has any damage to it that can allow carbon monoxide from the exhaust that should be going outside to be blown into the ductwork and into the home so they make they just make sure that it's all solid and that the exhaust goes where it is supposed to go and the heat goes into the home where it is supposed to go and that the exhaust and the heat are kept separate and then and then finally as I said they do include a whole house air duct cleaning and the way they do that is they have a very large negative air pressure machine which they connect to one of the main ducts of the furnace unit they go through the home they all of the individual room registers and then they pull that negative air pressure through the machine which has a HEPA filter in it which is the same type of filtering system they use in medical centers and hospitals and that pulls out all of the particulate matter you know dust pet dander smoke particles pollen traps it in the filter and keeps the air ducts clean so that the air coming into your home isn't returning all of that particulate matter into your home they don't use any solvents so you know for obvious reasons they don't want those fumes coming into your home and they don't use any brushes or scrubbers on the inside of the ducts what they've discovered is that that can actually leave tiny scratches on the inside of your ductwork and that can serve in the future to actually trap and hold more dust later on so this is the cleanest way they've found to clean the ductwork in a home if and as I said yeah okay please go ahead did you have a question sorry which company did you show you calling from again yes HVAC services it's HVAC and that's that simply stands for heating ventilation and air conditioning and it's the HVAC services center of Diamond Bar we cover most of Southern California from San Diego on up to San Luis Obispo and we're a local local family-owned company we don't subcontract our to all of our technicians in fact I'm an appointment setter even I am we're all employees of the company they don't farm out any of their work our technicians are bonded licensed and insured and as I was saying the whole package we're offering right now is a flat $65 fee and that's there are no taxes no additional charges and that's actually less than what we normally charge for just the air duct cleaning and it also includes the inspection and tune-up well you know here's here's something because the last time that someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I should have publishin be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but did that really hurt and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know goggle or phone call or or or whatever whatever it is of course uh well I don't take payments over the phone as the appointment setter our technicians don't accept payment until after they're completed with the work and you're satisfied with it and the work is guaranteed well yeah since you you pull up that way maybe you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello yeah so here's yeah can you hear me on the low are you there yes sir yes sir I am can you hear him oh yeah hi you know sorry I have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is not so good yes sorry what were you saying again oh forgot where we left off thought I lost your call yes but we'd love to come out and yeah schedule appointments and as I say you don't need to pay the technicians until after they're completed with their work and you're satisfied with it we can send out someone tomorrow we have a number of appointments that are available if you'd like me to put you on the schedule let's see actually we could if it would be convenient come out this afternoon as well we do have some technicians who are going to be very close to there well you know with the low finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how was this going through how how was this going to work I'm not quite sure I understand your question using Mindy the amount for the service well are you that that does sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here and is it yeah I mean it's something that that I've told that I should be looking at my third eldest Larissa she I think I mentioned Laura shall be full yes yes she she says that though that I should be going for something like nish but it's just a matter of what you know what what is most appropriate from for the time and I guess what not so I could you just hang on for one second here hang on I'd be with a habit of course yes so sorry sir but no no sorry what were you saying there again oh I was going over some appointment times that we do have available so that we can get someone out there we can lock in that price it is half price we know we would normally charge 100 2995 for all of those services together they're beginning to go a little bit fast I think as the weather has gotten warmer people are starting to think about getting their air conditioners in tune this is something that only needs to be done annually so the service they come out and perform for you it takes some only takes in about an hour there are two technicians we send out as a team and that'll be good for another year so it's a it's a year's worth of maintenance essentially this will get you up until the beginning of next year's cooling system for the sixty five dollar fee is someone someone did bids say last week that is someone did Co last week about the same thing what was it was that you I don't I'm afraid I don't have anybody know that it's it sorry what what ishow name again my name is my name is Karl and I'm calling from the HVAC services center I can give you a toll-free number if you'd like in my name if you

her bad because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know we're we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well I believe I've told you everything that they would do when they come out we've I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you they will what was that again oh yes I've gone over what the inspection entails and how they do the air duct cleaning for you is yes and the next level is sorry but again the next step really is for us to set an appointment time that will be convenient for you if you say that again like in place yes we would love to set an appointment for you would you prefer morning or afternoon hours we're quite flexible ish ish ish mmm-hmm and we can be out there this afternoon if you would like otherwise pretty much anytime from late morning to 5:00 o'clock or so
