mister did you see Lenny oh sorry I can barely hear you there okay so I really do apologize for the inconvenience it must be the background noise I have on the office here I do apologize for this is that it's a big office and it's hard to keep intro love it just very briefly here to check up upon availability here tomorrow on to explaining to you the reason why we're calling in about here I have on file contact number four three three and the reason why we call you today here and by the way this call may be monitored and recorded the reason why we call you is because we have a couple of vacation packages left in the area that of course you're currently qualified for for being an American Express card holder and of course I would like for you to please understand that this is a promotional price for today since it is under an awesome view that we're working with this packages and well once again my name is Jill Martin and today we're practically inviting you to enjoy out some of the most versatile great cases as Macy's in the world such as Orlando Europe Mexico the Caribbean the whole idea behind this promotion is to help you by 70 on a fabulous vacation and treat you like royalty for a week of course because we know that once you experience the five-star services you will be traveling with us again in the future but most importantly that you will tell your friends family members what a great time we had and that will help us a lot by you giving us good word about their attachment which is something that we're looking for and all we ask in return is that you take this similar to our resort and of course experience what we had to offer does that make sense now in this case are due to the tremendous response and will limited availability for this promotion we only allow one car per customer which means that once I go for all the details with you and I answer all three questions and you will just simply have to let me know if this is of course maybe something that you would like to take advantage of and actually moving into some of the most important details I would like for you to keep in mind that you will have up to two years and I had to travel meaning that at the moment you really don't have to feel any source of concern about any travel dates or who you will be traveling with and let me start off by mentioning as well that your initial vacation will start off at one of our most beautiful resorts for six days and five nights you will be able to choose from any of our resorts located from Dominican Republic to Costa Rica Spain Mexico Southeast Asia Orlando Florida the Bahamas but wherever that you decide to go we will certainly start off by taking you and your guests up at the airport we too are welcome cocktails upon your arrival at the resort and there will be all sorts any type of amenity here for you to enjoy like from gourmet restaurant and pools golf courses and even full-service about treatment centers a few many services or perhaps you can even relax on a harmless light under the Sun because a lot of our five-star resorts are actually beachfront properties which I feel it's like one of the most important things about our resource here you would also receive up to a 40% discount in case you're travel with your friends family members and they would like to take advantage of any outside tour or ascription in the area like maybe taking a trip to the Mayan ruins or swimming with the dolphins or snorkel on the second largest coral reef in the world but and at the same time you can enjoy any of the complimentary live shows and group activities available at the resort now this resort vacation Excelsior is currently free to adults and two children or 12 years later under who would you normally travel with yes this is okay is there any activity that you like doing on vacation like water sports maybe just torrents icy and relaxing oh good yes yes yes okay well I wanted to I wanted it one of the actual I areas that I would like to recommend it will be Costa Rica the reason why I'm recommending you cross to recover is because it feels like you're the type of person that really likes going through some amazing areas or that you would like to and I can actually tell you that at Costa Rica we have one of our most exotic five stars restored because you would be able to relax and up to 25 different pools which are technically Hot Springs of water because each one of the pools has a different temperature of water that is actually extracted from the volcanoes nearby the area to which you would even be able to go on a sword on a helicopter over them and experience the actual excitement of going over a volcano on a helicopter not only this but you can also take different types of ecological tours like visit many wildlife sanctuaries that are out there in the area interact with lots monkeys tuc√°n and not only this but on top of the recertification you're going to receive a second bonus which will consist of eight days and seven nights on an all-inclusive cruise for two adults and you would be able to choose from some of the most part cruise lines like Royal Caribbean Norwegian cruise lines carnival princess and there's close to over 40 different destinations to go to like Alaska Hawaii the Carribean that you can choose from and your only responsibilities are for the incidentals which would be in this case the airfare and a single reservation field $99 will be paid when you call in Cebu to travel dates now to recap this vacation package you would get six days five nights at one of our resorts all-inclusive accommodations this means that all your food snacks alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages even the tips are included and a 40% discount on any outside throws or excursions on top of this like I mentioned you would also would also include the a basis very nice on an all-inclusive food with 40 different cruises and destinations to choose from and we'll just to clarify you have 18 months from today's date to use the resort vacation and then you can take yourself an additional 12 months you use your all-inclusive cruise but even with this being said they are both 100% way more expendable giving you time for you to plan where when you would like to go and these vacations are also fully transferable which I find like it's the best part because now that christmas is coming up it just means that maybe you can give them away it's a great gift to someone that you love for this Christmas or you can even sell them out and these vacations are fully open they there aren't any blackout dates throughout the whole year so this does really mean that you can travel at any time as long as you can give us a forty-five days advance notice to guarantee their research and dates are we choice now if you would like to maybe travel or take advantage of the resort on a holiday for example I would personally suggest you to give us a 60 day advance notice so of course apparently the resort and the date now the retail value for this vacation package could easily be somewhere near over three thousand dollars however after we apply promotional discount and an exchange for you to take in the M&A through our resort this comes out to only 1199 US dollars that is not per person sir normal curve a case in that amount will cover two adults two children or twelve years of age or younger on the reserve vacation and I also have you covered on the all-inclusive cruise with two adults now thank you injections with the resorts we only accept American Express for this promotion which car will you be using today to secure this vacation package oh yes someone someone did bid fight last week that is someone did Co last week about the same thing what was it was that you it could have been me to be honest with you I call so many different customers and we've been registering so many of American Express customers that I would hardly remember I do apologize but in this case here like I was mentioning for the 1199 US dollars for this time because it could have been another partner of mine that called again the promotion's do change the middle for 1199 US dollars you will get the six-day five-night at the resort and the 8-day seven nights on the all-inclusive cruise do you do you like the fact that these vacations are open dated for the next two years and a half are these destinations that you would like to travel to sorry what's your name again my name is Julia Martin Julia my concern well it's funny that you should call
