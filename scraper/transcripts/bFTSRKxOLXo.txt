Ruggieri the century 21 excellence Realty how are you doing today uh sorry I'm [ __ ] belly here you there okay this is gary with century 21 excellence Realty how you doing today yes this is yes I go through the listings on the MLS and I see that your lists are your moment a veneer you pulled that off the market wanted to know if you'd you need some help listing that and selling that come oh goodness yes would you be interested in possibly receiving some comparables and I know you had it listed at 41 nine but I'd like to do some research and see if I can help tell that oh yes yes someone someone did did say last week noted someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you I had left a message so I'm not sure if that was me or not it could have been one very Holly what's your name again Jerry je rri with century 21 acres it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larisa see she was talking about this just this last week and you know CeCe's no she is very smart give about it because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and see oh wow distinctions you know we're we're all quite proud of oh yes yes so I'm sorry she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well I know that you have that listed at 41 nine I'd like to pull up some comparables in the area on to see what the home in the area are going for I know the auditor states that the that this home is valued at let's see here twelve thousand which is quite low but it looks like you've done some remodeling or something to this one on me see here I'm sorry I really couldn't quite catch you they were oh no it was that again no problem it looks like you've remodeled the home done some updating it has hardwood floors I mean it has potential that's for sure and I know you had mentioned owner financing on that also in the end the previous listing so what did it sit on the market about one hundred and seventy nine days so he maybe it was a little bit overpriced um you know if you price price them right then they move that's for sure but I'd be willing to sorry again I just maybe maybe it was a little bit overpriced I know you started out at forty nine thousand five hundred and then you lowered it down to forty one thousand nine hundred but maybe because it's only a two-bedroom and only has seven hundred and twenty four square feet maybe maybe it was a little bit overpriced or they're still tenants and the in the home at one time I think you had that rented out so again like in place yes no problem I know at one time you had tenants in in the home also maybe that was a problem and trying to sell it also I know sometimes when homes are occupied it it's harder to sell a home than you know then a home that's vacant if Sharon yes so it was probably hard to get showings and confirmed and that sort of saying I'm sure right sorry which company did you say you're calling from again yes century 21 excellence Realty outing on sperg and our special thing because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got in quite a bit of

sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here and oh yeah I really it's something that that I've been told that I should be looking at my third eldest Marissa she I think I mentioned Laura before yes yes she and she said that though that I should be going through something like this but it's just a matter of what you know what what is most appropriate for the time and I guess you wouldn't think so I could just hang on for one second here hang on yes absolutely yes so sorry about but uh don't worry Laurie or your side very good now I I totally understand you know you

sale much easier that's for sure and century 21 we have awesome gating program where it I mean it goes out to hundreds of different websites you know the advertising so it's just a great great company great you know advertising I just can't say enough about it so if you ever need my help in the future if I could provide my number to you and you can call me anytime I mean if you'd like and I like I say I understand family comes first you have to definitely take you know their thoughts and and that into consideration so I don't have a problem providing my number to you if you'd like that well you guys know someone someone did kids say last week noted someone did Cole offs week about the same thing what was it was that you well I I don't know if that was me I've made quite a few phone calls I go through the listings the expired listings and the ones that are temporarily off the market and it's very possible that was me I've made quite a few I made quite a few phone calls last week so that could have been me very possibly but I didn't talk to you do you have a voicemail a recorder on your phone I don't know I have your number written down from last week but I don't I I'm sure I would have remembered your your English accent you're from London aren't you are you in right then so sorry what was your name again Jerry je rri well it's failing that you should call because my third eldest Larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and you know see she's no she is very smart I won't give her bad because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite out so yes yes so we're saying that that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well I can let you know that we can we can list it if it doesn't sell then you aren't charged anything the broker fee would be 6% of whatever the listing price would be and that's paid at closing to the brokers that would be your only fee and of course I could hold open houses advertising is awesome get that out you know on many many websites marketing is definitely number one send out postcards in the area to you know let everyone know that it's been listed if you would like that of course but marketing is is definitely top priority I mean that's the name of the game to sell a home you know to get the word out there that's for sure alright I couldn't quite catch it catch you they will call us that again just marketing is a marketing is outstanding you know through century 21 and the marketing the advertising goes out to hundreds of websites to get get the word out there then the whole idea though is to price your home correctly so it sells and what I would do would be pull comparables up like sold comparables in the area where the home here located and also pull up active listings to see what you know what the listing prices were sorry where again yes I would just pull up listings and also so comparables to kind of see where you know where this property stands price-wise this one's over off saying right Avenue kind of over in that area I think isn't it is you know again again please yes yeah I would I would like to if if you would like me to I could pull up comparables in the area and see what what the values are going forward the values are starting to come up a little bit the only thing is I would want to pull up comparables to get a better look at you know what the prices are going for in the area because I see this was listed for almost six months about six months and it didn't sell at 41:9 so I'm thinking maybe that's a little bit high on the list price yes yes yes so it's um I know it's a to store it has two bedrooms in one full bath it only has about seven hundred and twenty four thousand have there been a lot of updates to it honey or not have you done a lot of updating to it where you sorry David companies you show you're calling from again ah century 21 excellence Realty well you know here's something because the last time that someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or or phone call or whatever whatever it is absolutely you say your daughter's name is Rachel oh yeah I think if you pull it that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here um I yes can you hear me hello are you yes Lenny can you hear me okay hello sorry I have a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is also good yes sorry what were we saying again and I don't want to cause any problems with the family or anything but if you need some help selling this home or if you'd like to give your your eldest daughter my number and she can call me to see what I can do to help you sell this home on one note well you know whether the world finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how I was this guy - I was a skater book well you wouldn't spend any money you would you would pay the broker my broker century 21 all brokers out there of course charge a fee to sell a home or sell a property and it looks like this one was at pop probably 6% you pay the broker fee at the time of closing so you would not pull any money out of your pocket until the closing day and then the broker fee would be paid for at closing so they're willing to pay for that does sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here and oh yeah I mean it's something that that I've been told that I should be looking at my third oldest Marissa or she I think I mentioned Laura show before Girish I am Erin she says that I should be going for something like this but it's just a matter of what you know but what is most appropriate from the time and I guess you won't think so I can just
