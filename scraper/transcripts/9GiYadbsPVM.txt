jason giving you a call for the kids wish network hope you're doing well today oh sorry I'm Billy here you there I'm calling for the kids wish network I hope you're doing well today it is this is steaming we're running a drive right now and we're trying to grant a wish for a sick and terminally ill child each and every day of the drive just wanted to touch base with them let you know and of course to make sure that we can count on just a very small tax-deductible gift for the drive okay oh good if this if I'm standing now our top level boosters Jeffrey have been 7550 or 35 could you help with one of those oh yes yes someone someone did kids say last week noted someone did call offs week about same thing what was it was that you know I don't believe it was perhaps there's just another children's charity but I tell you what Jeff you know if you're helping on others you know even that 35 that we talked about would certainly be a wonderful gift would that be comfortable for you it is what I can do are you know what was what's your name again it's the kids wish network and my name is Jason what I could do for you is get a letter as well as an envelope out there that's already addressed for you to return your generous check or money order I just wanted to make sure that that 35 dollar amount was comfortable for you to return to us well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just just last week and she's well she is very smart I'll give her bad because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know we're all quite about of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing oh so what more can you tell me about it well I tell you what we do is we grant a wish for a sick and terminally ill child each and every day of the drive now that can be anything from like a once-in-a-lifetime trip was their entire family and I mean that includes like cousins aunts uncles grandparents anybody that's involved in the kid's life or it could be anything as simple as like an iPad for them to keep in touch with their friends and their farm of treatment centers it's really just making sure that the only thing these children have to worry about is just being a kid and like I said you know we are a tax-deductible 501c3 nonprofit charity so about $35 of course would come out with a letter explaining what we're doing this year of course a thank you letter from the director as well as that envelope that I told you about in a tax receipt if you know you choose actually claim it on your deductions I mean really that's about the gist of it is there anything else that you have a question about Jeff I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you there we'll pull that again okay I'll slow down I'm sick I got a head cold too so that's not helping we grant wishes for sick and terminally ill children each and every day of our drive now that can be anything from like a once-in-a-lifetime trip with their whole family or you know for the children who are doing a little bit better you know it could be anything from an ipad to keep in touch with their friends or really just anything to take their mind off of treatment we just want to make sure that the only thing these kids have to worry about you know is just being a kid and you can be a huge part of that for that $35 donation at one time for the drive what I'd like to do Jeff is a get you have the phone with my verifier so we can make sure we have that address down correct and get you out that envelope as well as the letter for you to return that generous gift of 35 would that be comfortable for you this year the sorry again with the 35 dollar donation the one time for the year be comfortable once you do receive that envelope want you to say that very much like in please I was just wondering if $35 is a comfortable amount for you your return in the envelope once you do receive it for the kids it's $35 okay what I'm going to do then is I'm going to grab a verifier and make sure that we have that information but hang on the line I do want to say thank you so much Jeffrey I mean it's a very generous gift at 35 hello hi this is jason i have Jeffrey on the phone could you please verify his pledge for the kids

wooden to go on a vacation with their family they actually help out without and they play for all their lodging and expenses of course and if they also want to do maybe one of them wants to meet a

sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you they will pull that again I'm so sorry sir the kids wish network is a nationally recognized charitable organization it's dedicated infusing hope creating happy memories and improving the quality of life for children with terminal or life-threatening illness we basically help them out like if they want to go to Disneyland the kids wish network pays for their lodging and the travel expense and the time that they're there if they're going through a nasty chemo treatment at that particular time you know kids which has been known to put them up in a lodge resort to heaven on around the clock here of a nurse you know to help them with their their medications and things but they also give them a break from all of that and just let them to you know be kids so I mean it's a really really nice organization for these children who are you know sick or terminally ill cha children they just try to grant them the wish that they could just be brief for one moment of not being you know under the chemo treatments or the surgeries the shots and things like that they really try to help these children just to be children instead of reminding them that
