you're all quite proud of her yes yes so right yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing okay so what more can you tell me about it okay well with the default the basic air duct cleaning what we do as we hook up the machine we hook up this machine it's called a hepa machine and we hook it up to the main air duct in your home we closed all the other events in the house and we turn the machine on and it literally sucks out all the little dust bunnies all the moles I can you know cuz that can grow in there any kind of you know just regular dust and dander things like that that would pass those filters there are in the air conditioning system along and because like the furnace is attached to the it's all in one system usually but what that machine does extracts all those little things that you breathe in on a daily basis because if you don't get them cleaned out it can push even through the filters that could push little particles that can cause asthma as it could cause COPD or you know any kind of allergy attack you know and those are really important and a lot of people don't know that your indoor air when you have the air on it if you don't get it serviced the air is for 24 25 at least four to five times more polluted than the air on the outside so you know a lot of the homeowners not very unaware of that you know so we want to constantly you know every six months to a year at least change out the air filters and get your system cleaned out plus with the tune up the tune-up keeps your machine working view ficient you know
