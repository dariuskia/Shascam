hello there my name is Cheryl I'm calling from Sirius XM and the college recorded for quality is available please oh sorry I'm barely hear you there all I'm sorry sir my name is Cheryl I'm calling from Sirius XM radio regarding your toyota sienna yes is yes the free trial of our satellite radios up on the fourth of june in your vehicle so we were calling to offer you six months of service for thirty dollars plus fees and taxes oh good and you do get 140 channels of our select package to enjoy which is normally 1599 a month so you are going to pay five dollars a month in a one-time payment and all the plans automatically renew and bill at current rates so circa I just get your address there on oh please is yes somewhat someone did say last week though that someone did call us we commit the same thing but was that you I know actually sir I can see in the note someone called you here I think they had a hard time hearing you so I'm just giving you a quick call back to offer you the same offer that they offer you which is six months for thirty dollars plus season taxes so it does go by your stake their service or you want to double check but you're still in Connecticut yes sorry what was your name again Cheryl well it's fine that you should call because my third eldest ver si si she was talking about this just this last week and you know she's she is very smart I'll give about it because I first in the family to go to university and see half this distinction you know about it oh yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it okay well sir it does come and has 100 this specific packets at a model for you today has 140 channels so the next time you wrote in your vehicle in your toyota sienna there is rather going to be i think it's a media button or a radio button and if you play around those buttons you'll eventually see the letters XM for Sirius XM in some cases sir you can also see s80 which stands for satellite and if you click that button that you will see when you do go in your truck it will load you all of the channels so once you have that loaded up there say for example if you want to listen to the 50s music well you would just hit the button like the Sikh button on your radio until you've seen channel 05 and that will be all 50s music now if you want to hear 60s news if you put it to channel 6 70s 80s and so far and so on now there's anything from rock and metal to classical and and you name it it's there right there's 80 music channel now besides the music channels there is also a lot of comedy there are sports there's news there's politics there's live concerts there's taryn halls you name it it's there so it is definitely worth the five dollars a month for six months so in your state sir including everything it would only cost you thirty four dollars and ten cents to have the select package for the next six months so your term would be from the fourth of june until the fourth of december now as i said before just so we're clear this is an introductory offer so of course after the six months it will resort back to the normal price but there is no obligation for you to continue so if you feel that you maybe don't need all of these channel sir you can call us anywhere from june fourth until december fourth and we can offer you a different package and you also have that opt-out option so of course or you could make a change on your account whenever you want so as far as today's phone call I would just simply make sure that your address is correct on Jack and pick which way you would like to be billed for the thirty four dollars and ten cents so then once the source of June hits when your free trial expires you won't have to have a lapse in your radio that is the very day that your new six-month term will click insert I'm sorry I couldn't quite catchy catchy level what was that again as of the fourth of June your free trial will expire but if you take the offer that I have for you today then it will click in on the fourth of jewel so say for example if you wanted to be charged the thirty four dollars and ten cents it would cost you to a debit card or a credit card we would not take the payment out of your card until the fourth of June sir but the sari with again it's thirty four dollars in ten cents if you would like to take part of the six-month offer and you wouldn't be paying for it until the fourth of June sir okay so that again like in please the fourth of June that's when your free trial is over in your toyota sienna it's fish okay so do you want to sign up sir it cost you thirty four dollars and ten cents to have six months of the service sorry which company could you show you calling from again Sirius XM radio so remember you mentioned before that your daughter your smartest daughter your oldest daughter had told you about it and told you to get into it well you know here's the thing because the last time that I've someone called up spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see see what wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know let that happens you know but it bit that really be good and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know gobble or phone call or whatever it is now sir what I can do to put your mind at ease that your daughter probably would would be impressed with is of course they would rather you have it build on a debit or credit card sir but just to make sure that I don't you know I don't have to capture your personal credit card number or they can do instead sir it's just send you owed an invoice in the mail so that way there when it comes you can discuss that with your daughter and if you decide that you want to take the offer you can send a check or money order in for the thirty four dollars and ten cents but if something happens between now and the time you get the invoice if you decide that maybe you don't want to continue the cancellation number is written on the invoice so once we send it to you if you decide that you don't want it you can just call us and cancel it sir oh yeah scissors since you put it that way I mean you've been quite friendly straightforward with me here hello yessir i'm here hello are you laughs I'm here yes sir I'm here oh yes sorry this is I have a have a bit of a a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is not so good yes oh sorry what were you saying again I say we'll send you out of invoice in the mail server so that way there if you decide that you don't want to continue you can just call the cancellation number that is written on the boys and that way they're your daughter's won't get mad at you for giving out your personal credit card information over the phone sir well you know with the world financers the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how it was this going through how was a skater book well what I will do is I will send you out of invoice in the mail now when you get the invoice in the mail if you want to take advantage of the offer I have for you today which again is six months of service for thirty dollars foster fees and taxes you'll get the paper bill in the mail so that way there I wouldn't won't have to capture any of your private credit card information so again when the when the invoice comes in the mail if you decide by the time you get that that you don't want to have this service the cancellation number is written right on your invoice there so all they have to do is just review the details with you and you agree to the payment and I send you the invoice and then you're all set to go to keep your radio for another six months okay well are you said that does sound good i mean
