you today hello hello are yellow oh yeah I'm here I'm just calling on behalf of the conservative party of canada how are you today oh yes sorry sorry what were you saying again I said I'm calling on behalf of conservative party of canada uh sorry I can barely hear you there I'm just calling on behalf of conservative party history is this isn't yeah hmm and we just want to thank you so much for your support and and keeping on our team here but I'll be brief I don't want to take up too much out of your busy day but we do have a lot of work to do the Liberals they're trying to raise the GST and bring the carbon tax they'll make everything we do and by even more expensive than it already is for Canadians and as you may have heard they're trying to cover up that 30 billion dollar deficit by raising taxes and adding taxes so we think it's crazy that middle-class families are being forcibly deeper into their pocket to pay for the Liberals high-spin agenda so what we are doing today Lenny is out reaching out to our supporters across the country to see if you want to help with the contribution you will get a tax cut of seventy-five percent back but most importantly every dollar we raise though will be used to bring our low tax message to Canadians so that we can protect our children and grandchildren from mountains of debt for generations to come so the party would like to count on your help today let me do you think that's possible oh yes yes yes you know yep today well yeah we want to thank you so much for your support but we are doing some fundraising as well we do have the gold level at one hundred silver 50 and bronzer 25 do you think you'll be able to contribute a hundred dollars for conservative party today as I load too much oh yes yes someone someone did did say last week that is someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you oh I don't think it was me actually started working the couple days ago actually but I'll put this down here so you so you don't get this call for a while because we don't bother you too often yes sorry what's your name again what's my name well its value that you should call because my third eldest Larissa no she was talking about this just this last week and AH you know she's no she is very smart I'll give her that because you know she was the first in the family could go to university and so I'll hashed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it oh yeah the reason the reason we do want to let you know how the Liberals they are trying to raise it is so you know they're trying to bring that carbon tax but honestly I since we don't get any corporate hub like provincial parties we do rely heavily on our supporters so that we can recruit the new young members you know and the undecided members so that we can you know continue to be a stronger party and go against those liberals in a few years here that's what we are calling today is if you want to make a contribution and you clear today you maybe want to do that today I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch the catchy level what was that again oh yeah so we're just so trying to get those are resources so we can recruit new young and undecided members so that we can
