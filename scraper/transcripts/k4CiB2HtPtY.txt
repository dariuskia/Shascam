you guys are at the reason that we were giving you a call Lenny is we're with local splash we're a data service provider to Google and Bing and what problem I called you Lenny is we wanted to speak with you about getting on the front pages of Google and beans for the categories in your area okay so I'm basically what that means to you Lenny is that anytime anyone does a search for any of the services that you provide we make sure that you always pop up on the first page does that make sense oh yes yes so on someone it did say last week that someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you okay I mean we may have touch bases with you but as of now I know that we're not working with you basically Lenny we did a basic search for for the services that you have to offer there in your city and when I go to do a search for the when I go and do a search for all services and you also there at your company a list of your competitors are showing up you guys on the back pages so I'm despite you know your good reviews your good ratings you guys aren't showing up on the first page of the results so on what we want to go ahead and do for you Lenny is make sure that we get you on the front pages so that one customers go to look at the services that you have to offer though actually find you on the front pages rather than your competitors okay and that's why I
