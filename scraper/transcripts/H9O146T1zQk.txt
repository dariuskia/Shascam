interest in one of our home security promotions is that right good this is all right perfect let me just ask them in a are you a homeowner sir oh good yes yes yes yeah well congratulations then okay and do you already have a home security system oh yes yes someone someone did kids say last week no did someone didn't call us week about the same thing what was it was that you called about the home security promotion if sorry what's your name again my name is Ian well it's fine that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just just last week and you know she's well she is very smart i won't give her bad because you know she's the first in the family to go to university and she asked with distinctions you know where we're all quite far affair yes yes so um yeah she was saying this that i should look you know get into the winter sort of things so what more he tell me about it absolutely our systems here they are a complete wireless security system that's mean you at least we will not be doing a bunch of drilling in here sold no holes will be around there i mean we don't need to run a bunch of wire pretty much because it's all wireless installation since you're on had one takes average about an hour to get you all set up on everything and start installing this a state-of-the-art came back because sure they will pull that again you're okay we will start on the invite and stuff again yeah we start off on over the whole installation by installing it's a state-of-the-art it's a keypad and you would put it by whatever where you think you would use the most so that way when you're coming in and out you can at least arm and disarm the alarm system like your convenience and now say that again on the actual just the keypad part I mean it's just putting a keypad by the closest door if it's okay on the keypad itself the box there's also an LCD screen on it the way it is pretty big so I mean it's super easy to see and use it's not too sensitive towards malfunctions on the screen you'll see like a weather date and time always just the security system is connected to the National Weather Service that way if anything is going on in your area with bad weather you guys actually would be alerted even if your power is out your security system will actually be on because as a built-in battery sorry oh now certain companies i darn its art to get i'm from integrity securities our security system is 2gig fire that's our minutes well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and you know to me on the phone I got in quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she would wouldn't speak to me for a week now how is it that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you
