this hey Amy tomahawk crazy and I can do what I don't have the thing for me oh sorry I'm belly here you there yes yes hear me I'm looking to see what Fred regarding the electric bill yes this is yes ok well my name is Randall Connor we have experienced you hadn't ruled your peepee in lville I'm a while back into the energy choice program to get reduced price on the electric by using a supplier and when you're in the program you're entitled to the lowest rate available so what that means on your next meter reading the call seer electricity's want to drop down to eight cents per kilowatt hours so you're going to receive a reduction but the reason we have to call you on this they used to send out information and weigh your bill and his little inserts and we're finding that a lot of people either toss it out or they just overlooked it so it's now my job's just help facilitate that for you a quick question though you haven't recently enrolled into any government assistance on the electrical attic oh good yes yes yes okay great so you can qualify your rates going to drop down at 8.35 that'll be on the supply portion of your ppl bill it's actually for the next three months so you're going to see a lot of savings there the servicing has recipe so for this is five a correct is someone someone did kids say last week no did someone did call offs week about the same thing what was it was that you I mean it possibly can the rates lowering its Robin down the 8.35 I'm your account eligible for it that's why we're calling today always had to verify a few information real quick and we have to now this is 40 ppl customers only I just have to verify your account number with you that's going to be on page 34 any previous bill and I realize you were not expecting my phone call today so i can hold if you need a minute to find that yeah what i'll do i'll read it out to you and you just let me know if what we have on file is correct yes sorry what was your name again no I i'm going to i'm going to verify your account number with you sir this is for ppl customers only i have to verify your account number with you that's when I'm be on page 3 of any previous bill I was saying I realized you were not expecting my phone call today so i can hold if you need a minute to find that well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and you know cc's no she is very smart i won't give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that i should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it so this is something you already had a role in to sir this is its accounts lowering its called pennsylvania energy choice program i'm not sure exactly when you enroll into it it can be anywhere from like one or three years ago but the reason why everyone in our system is enrolled into that program and when you're in that program you know you're entitled they have authorized suppliers in that program where it gives the consumers like yourself a chance to shop around within that particular network of authorized suppliers to be able to it a lower rate on your on your electric bill because pencil Pennsylvania is a deregulated state so you know consumers have a chance that they actually have the choice to be able to pick out who they want their utility company to supply their energy so you know you have that option and so obvious all right I have an equal quite catch it catch you they will pull that again no no this is something you hadn't I'm not sure when you enrolled your electric bill into the energy choice program but everyone in our system they you enrolled your your ppl bill into the energy choice program and Pennsylvania went because Pennsylvania is a deregulated state so when I want to when a state's be regulated the consumer has to pick out a supplier they get to choose their own supplier who they want their utility company to supply energy to so you have that choice in you know which which you want to supply your energy to your utility company but um you get enrolled I doesnt sit I'm not sure exactly when but everybody in this system is had enrolled their their bill into that program that's why I'm calling you today and in that program you're always entitled to the lowest rate available so that's why you know you're receiving a phone call today are you familiar with it at all it's called Pennsylvania energy choice the little sorry but again no I said are you familiar with it the energy choice program sir good would you show that i can rewrite include yeah yes or are you familiar with the energy choice program yes this dish okay yeah it's ova your bill what's what's going to happen is everybody pays a particular price per kilowatt hour when we apply this reduction to your bill it's going to be allied on your next meter reading you're dropping down to eight point three five cents so you're paying eight cents per kilowatt hour and it's fixed for three months so your price protected sorry okay a lot of savings or so you're calling from again experiencers that's the authorized supply in a firm you had already enrolled into into their program if you look on your bill you'll see it on there you're already in the program sir hello exactly no here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on
