pull that again the estimates that we leave with homeowners they're free and they're good for 15 months just so you know the homeowner whenever sometimes they're not ready to do work at that time they do it like four or five months later that's good because the estimate that we eat it's good for like almost over there years so whenever they're ready they can give us a call we also leave them with

she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know that's the bit that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know

just a free consultation we leave you with the free estimate and the discount and then we show you that the different Pink's that we carry from our company and then that's it it takes no more than like a 15 minutes the only reason while it takes longer is is that the homeowner is asking a lot of questions to my specialist but overall it takes no more than 15 minutes he shows you the estimate the discount he showed you the paint that we have over here at my company and then he leaves you with their business cards so you can call us back on it whenever you're ready and that's it and that
