in our utility rates well for this year alone the Public Utilities Commission have approved the 15.6 percent increase in our utility rates so they keep increasing each and every year so the state instead has created a program and has funded it with 2.5 billion dollars now the state is also mandating major utility companies to offer financial options to customers who have high electric bill as an incentive for you to look at the solar now aside from this there are also federal programs and potentially some local rebates which are all meant to help homeowners with the start-up costs of your going solar with idea that individual homeowners like you could lower eliminate the amount of money that you have to spend on electricity each and every month so what this means is right now you are

her electric bill towards a system that can generate all of your electrical needs now what we're trying to do is to see whether or not solar would be suitable for your home and if it is we will have

solar would even work on your home now the solar technician will suggest the best system that will cover all your electrical needs show you how much that would normally cost and then qualify you for programs and fundings that will help you offset a portion of the cost and the good thing about this is that with the information that he will provide to you it is going to be good for up to a year so this similar consultation is for free there's no obligation so it's really just an information visit to let you know what your options are well you know with the low finances the way they are I know

discuss with you the system that will do that and then he will tell you how much it's going to cost and then he will qualify you for the programs and the fundings to help you offset a portion of the cost because with the program it provides that it will cover a very large portion of the cost of the system and anything that covered is paid off with the bills that is equal to or less than what you're currently spending on electricity meaning to say that whatever you're spending now on electricity will just be rerouted towards a payment of your panels so that's what the that's why we send
