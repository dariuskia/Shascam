afternoon sir I'm sure you heard our air duct special recording and just to let you know currently we are offering a promotion right now to clean the ventilation system for a discounted rate and what we offer at this time is to clean all of the air ducts in your home and we also provide a 16-point chat furnace inspection so we do carefully inspect for gas expose importantly and if you have a dryer with in the laundry room we also make sure to clean out the dryer ducks as well so we do remove all the dust and lint from the previous dryer loads and I'm most important if you have an attic we also offer a free safety inspection on the attic so we do carefully inspect for any rodent troubles and especially for any traumatic problems and now we do check for the installation levels as well and now we do make sure the air ducts don't have any leaks any kind of rips or tears and we do make sure the air is blowing evenly throughout the vent system so that way we help you save money on the utility bill throughout the year now uh normally we do charge between two to three hundred dollars for the air duct cleaning job that we do but like I briefly mentioned we are only doing it at this time for only thirty nine ninety nine and it does take about 30 to 45 minutes for the deep cleaning process but the it's very clean and it's very efficient with the air duct cleaning and not just let you know we do have appointments as early as Monday but what works best for you like mornings or afternoons sorry I barely hear you there I'm sorry I can hear me now yes this is oh yes so I'm not sure if you heard what I was gibbering about but so once again we're doing the air duct motion right now for only thirty nine ninety nine we offer to clean all of your air ducts in the home and this also includes a furnace inspection and we also clean up the dryer duct so if you have a laundry room in the dryer we do make sure to clean out let all the dust and lint from the previous dryer load from the dryer ducks itself and then most importantly if you also have an attic we do a free safety inspection on the attic so we do carefully spec for any rodent troubles and I most importantly for any extra mite infestation and we like I mentioned earlier too we do the installation level checks so we do make sure to make sure that the whole air point evenly throughout the event system so we do go from that event to test out the air and that way the air is flowing evenly for you throughout the whole system and the reason why we do that the air flow analysis because we have found from the past cleaning job that we have for other homeowners some or are only cool you're hitting one portion of the home and when it should be the entire home so that's the reason why we do test out the air to make sure all the vents are blowing the even amount of air pressure so that way it's equal amount of error and like I did mention now we do normally charge between two to three hundred dollars for this type of Aragon cleaning the reason why is because it does depend on the amount events and also there are ducks that we clean but for this particular promotion I does not matter if you have five or fifty vents will clean them all for that same exact price of thirty nine ninety nine and it's a very quick very clean and efficient process because it does take about 30 to 45 minutes to do all the deep cleaning and all the air ducts so it's very clean and very efficient and just to let you know we do have some availabilities for Monday but I wanted to ask you first what typically works better for you like mornings or afternoons oh good if well I'll just let you know we do have some openings on Monday and we do start up pretty early in the morning and we do start from 10 to 12 we also have one two three q 24 and the last time cloud that we have on monday will be from 3 to 5 p.m. so do you think any of those times for you perhaps work for monday and once again this is Monday May sixteenth oh yes yes someone someone did did say last week noted someone did call us week about the same thing what was it was that you it may have been because we are in the other area actually where we do serve the entire Bay Area just to let you know so we have been calling all the individuals all homeowners of primarily for the air ducts special because we only do this once you actually maybe twice a year but right now this is our spring time promotion for the spring time cleaning to prep up for the summer time just to let you know there but to answer your question yes we do service the entire Bay Area and i'm originally from daly city but in this case we do have you know locations across the bay beach as well so we do service san jose like milpitas Richmond Burlingame and all across the bay area across the bay bridge and back so we are very efficient with air duct cleaning we've been in business for over 15 years so we are licensed bonded and insured just to let you know yes sorry what was your name again my name is Mark laughing yes sir well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and yes he sees no she is very smart I'll give her bad because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so yes you were saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well they're the one of the most important details that I can provide you with is as far as how we do the job what we do exactly is we we have a HEPA vacuum and we hook up our negative air vacuum to the vent that's most accessible so we do pull up from the easiest access then usually by the main entrance by the front door and then what we do is we seal off the rest of the vents or the home and what we do is we let the vacuum pull out all the dust and debris with a reverse air flow so the machine that we have the HEPA vacuum that we have is self containing so all the dirt us debris and bacteria stays one of the I vacuum and like I said process takes about 30 to 45 minutes to complete at the most maybe about an hour at the most but usually takes about 45 minutes for the people cleaning process of the air ducts so just let you know we do also amends I i if I'm not sure if I mentioned it to you but we do a 16-point cooling and heating system inspection so we do check the thermostat operation and we do also inspect the filters we also inspect the wiring and we do tighten all the electrical connections one important thing that we also check we check the blowers so the indoor blowers and the motor we make sure there's no kind of dirt buildup we do inspect the bearings and we lubricate all the moving parts and this does include the belts and also the attention so we do the necessary adjustments on the tension and we do definitely inspect and now we'd also check the terrain image as well and also the defrost operations and now in this case we do inspect the Ducks as well to make sure that they're sealed off and they're secure most importantly and that's the reason why we do check to see if there's any leakages any rips or tears and the reason why is because if you are losing out error you're losing out money on the utility bill so we do make sure that it's tightened up and there's no kind of gaps in between the air ducts so it's very detailed cleaning the like I did mention where we usually take 30 to 45 minutes for the cleaning process but honestly like I mentioned earlier we do take you we usually take about three hundred dollars for the packaging of the air duct processing so it's very expensive but you know usually you know we do run this promotion throughout the year for the three hundred dollar amount but like I did specifically let's specify to you it's 3999 for the time being because it's our spring times promotion yes I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch e level what was that again I in regards to the promotion I was saying that we usually run this throughout the year for three hundred dollars or more because it does seriously depend on the amount of air ducts that we clean but like I mentioned it's we're only charging 3999 for the time being because it's our spring time promotion but like I mentioned once the springtime promotion is over we're back to charging three hundred dollars and up for the primarily air duct cleaning yes the Liz sorry again on which parts are would you say that again again
