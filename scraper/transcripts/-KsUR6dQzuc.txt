actually need to speak to the person who handles your AT&T account uh sorry I'm  Billy here you there okay how's that is that better yes can you hear me now all right Lenny I actually need to speak to the person who handles your AT&T account there oh good all right so that would be you right Lenny oh yes yes someone someone did did say last week that someone didn't call last week about the same thing what was it was that you well it might have been no Lenny I quite call quite a bit every day but the reason for the call 18 in this call may be monitored recorded for Quality Assurance purposes Lenny the reason for the call AT&T recently upgraded your area to fiber optics and completed the first phase which was migrating your internet from DSL to u-verse so that's why you have a u-verse internet it's fiber optic internet the next step would be to migrate your phone line to fiber optic u-verse voice right now your phone lines are on the copper network the phone line through the wall Jack there well we're looking to do is put those phone line there into a router and it's called is a fiber optic wireless router so that's the fiber optic network and it's called voice over IP or VoIP and offers you a much better overall experience and you could ever get with the traditional copper Network also because of the limitations of the copper network because it is an older deteriorating networks six years old very limited on the functions with the fiber optic you get about 19 features for instance simultaneous ring voicemail to text located call screening as well as your online account portal which gives you full account management so you can do a lot more with this also you're on two different billing platforms because you're on the two different networks once the migration is complete you'll go back to one bill because you'll be on the one network so your phone and Internet that's on separate bills right now will consolidate onto one bill and that would be for your one line 24 mix of internet speed for 135 that's what the speed is you currently have so that would be 135 for your phone and Internet the installation is free there's no early termination fee on the plan and that also includes unlimited local and long distance calling so that helps stabilize your bill so you don't get the fluctuations in your bill and it also includes the equipment so everything is all-inclusive 135 the installation is free like I said so there's no hidden cost and there's no early termination fee on the plants you can also return that price your year to keep the same price or if you get a better promotion you can always opt out without being penalized so that would complete the migration did you have any questions on that Lenny yes sorry what's your name again my name is Steve well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest Larissa she was talking about this just just last week and you know she she's well she is very smart I'll give her bad because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well fiber optic is basically a what the technology is is a glass tube underground where light travels through it I don't understand all the technical specs on that but but basically it's a light that travels through a tube a glass tube and it's just a mud it's lightning speed on the Internet but you also get a direct feed so you know not you know with the old DSL Network where it was kind of like you know you get dips in the internet because of the bandwidth well with the fiber-optic you don't have that but they you already have the u-verse internet that's not what we're mainly concentrating on here today what we're concentrating on now is the phone lines you're going to get a crystal-clear sound for the phone you're going to get a much broader service because you got more features available to you on the fiber-optic and then also you're going to be getting a secure dedicated line so no more static on the line no more fading in and out phasing and all that kind of stuff that goes away and you just have a nice crystal-clear sound on your phone and that and that would be your phone and Internet on the same bill now because right now you're on two different bills you'll go back to one bill so then you know in the next couple of months when your bills start coming in it'll just have the phone and internet on the one bill and that's it I mean couldn't quite catch it because you they will what was that again okay I was just saying that you'll go back to one bill because you'll be on the same network fiber optic but you understood the fiber optic I know I said a few things there you did understand the theory behind fiber optic right but the sorry again okay again fiber-optic is a glass tube where light travels through it it's Underground you can't see it it's Underground but but what it does is it gives you a crystal-clear sound on your phone and it gives you a much broader service because you have more features available to you on the fiber-optic it's a better sight again I get closer okay it's not I'm not sure how to say this any it's a glass tube a glass tube underground where light travels through it and it gives you a much better quality service than you can get with the copper network that's as clear as I can put it on that one that that's the technology right there fiber-optic so your phones will now be on a dedicated secure line you'll also be getting much better crystal-clear and broader Internet excuse me broader feature type of phone more to the fiber-optic than there is to the copper so that's why we're doing a nationwide migration is a much more dependable service than what you have now that's it sorry which company did you say you're calling from again again I'm your AT&T solution provider well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for only now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or or phone call or or or whatever whatever it is well I guess the question is did you want to go ahead and finish out the migration on your phone well yeah since you you pull it that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello yes I'm listening hello are you there yes sir I'm here can you hear me yes sorry this is I have a have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is not so good yes sorry what were you saying again I was just saying would you like to go ahead and finish up the migration on your phones right now your Internet's on the fiber-optic but your phone is not all the technician needs to do is switch out the router that you have and then you'll be back on the fiber-optic network for your phone and Internet and you'll be on one-one billing platform and then you'll have a better quality service on your phones that's all I was asking did you want to finish up the migration well you know with the world finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were howl how that was this guy true how is this going to work well your your new bill would be 135 well that that does sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here and yeah I mean it's something that that I've been told that I should be looking at my third eldest whereas Marissa or she I think I mentioned Laura before yes yes she she said that that I should be going through something like this but it's just a matter of what you know but what is most appropriate for the time and I guess one last thing so I could you just hang on for one second here hang on sure yes so sorry about but oh that's alright that's alright what were you saying there again again I wanted to see if we could go and do a voice verification go over some disclosures that AT&T would like and go ahead and have a technician come out and switch out the router for you oh yes yes so what someone did did say last week that someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you it may have been it may have been I do I do call quite a bit but there's other people calling on this as well in different offices around the country we're trying to do this is a nationwide migration so we're just trying to get everybody on the fiber-optic network on the phone so it may have been there may not have been I'm not sure but I mean like I said I can go ahead and take care of that today for you if you want start the process and then how the technician come out and do that for you if you want yes sorry what's your name again my name is Steve well file you that you should call because my third eldest larisa she she was talking about this just this last week and you know everything she's no she is very smart I won't give her bad because you know she was the first and the family could go to university and she hashed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yes she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it I've told you about all I can tell you on it if you want to go ahead and have a technician come out and you'll be happy to answer any questions you have when it comes out to do this did you want to go and do that I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it because she they will also no
