get done yes sorry what was your name again I was saying did you get an estimate for the job that you were hoping to do what what job are you hoping to start on your home well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and no great great what is it but I can laugh oh maybe an estimate for she was the first to the family at university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes so I wish I thinking gas-x is into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it oh you were saying exactly what was it for what did you want to start on your home money I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it because she labeled ascetically oh I was just saying what did you want to start on the home was it a was it a kitchen remodel or what project is you want to start but the sorry again Oh me my name it's Sophie with Jonathan construction would you say that again like in please yeah I was wondering if you were ready to do any type of home improvement on your home I love Diamond Bar it's a really small and congested City it is but it's at the same time it has an airy feeling and I'm sure you have a really nice property out there in Diamond Bar I was wondering uh what type of home improvements you're looking to do yes yes are you sitting on a hill would you need some type of oh I don't know you tell me you know you know more than I do on on your property or exactly what were you hoping to start or let me now I don't want to talk in circles I really have that much time to just you know talking circles with you I do want to get to some other some of the customers who are in need of remodeling but if you do have a good project I would love to send someone out there and give you a free estimate it'd be good for 12 months no cost no obligation to you well I'll lose me is about here's an hour and a half last time that I the shaman called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens but that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than certainly any you know gobble or phone call or whatever it is oh no no no no it all depends I think family first absolutely but where would the family gather if there was no home oh yeah your sisters since you pulled up that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here oh yes oh I will not go you know oh yes sorry this is I have a have a bit of a bit of a problem that this phone and my hearing is not so good yes sorry what were you saying again just waiting on you to give me a project that I could does schedule you in well you know with the world finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were well how was this going through is how I was asked I can book well pricing isn't my specialty I just at the appointments it really depends on the product to choose and your needs that's why my manager comes out to give you a free estimate and in fact the estimate once again is good for up to one year well and so with that in mind that sound good I mean you have been very patient all man here and is it yeah yeah I mean it's something that but I can tell you what I should be looking at my third eldest were Laura she I think I mentioned Laura before yes yes she she says that the boat that I should be going for something like this but just a matter of what you know what what is most appropriate for the time and I

to keep the Ducks in oh yes yes someone someone did did say last week noted someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you possibly yes sorry what was your name again and and
