they can afford because you know they know that if we allow Hillary Clinton to get elected in November we're stuck with Obamacare for who knows how long and we'll end up with you know a Supreme Court that will rubber-stamp every liberal things she pushes through with no regard for the Constitution and you know Trump needs you as an active member of his team he's not looking to any special interest

gift of $85 or $75 would you say that again again please sir you know Americans want to contribute whatever they can to Trump's election because if we allow Hillary Clinton to get elected in November Americans are going to be stuck with Obamacare for who knows how long and we'll end up with a Supreme Court that will rubber-stamp every liberal think she pushes through with absolutely no regard for the American Constitution and you know Trump needs you as an active member of his team and he's not looking for any special interest groups or the liberal media to for help he wants good people like you to play the defining role in getting him elected so you know we would like you to stand with us by donating a reasonable gift of $85 or $75 if this all right sir so can I put you down for you know the $85 or you know down for the $75 level sorry which company did you show you were calling from again I am calling from MDS communication sir well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know if they're more important than any you know job or four phone call or whatever it is I see well you know sir I really don't have the perfect answer for that one but you know sir sometimes sometimes we have to stand up for what we believe in and if that means hurting family sometimes sometimes that is necessary oh and ultimately is ultimately into your decision better but you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello yeah yes I'm here sir hello are you there hi hello yeah I'm here I'm here oh yes sorry this is I have a have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is also good yes I told you sorry what-what were you saying again I said I said I totally understand sir I've had those problems myself I I had an old old phone and you know I could barely hear a thing out of it for a while luckily I upgraded but oh man that was that was something else well you know with the low finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how old how it was this guy true yeah how was this going to work well sir you know I would ask you for a donation and it want what level I can put you down for a dollar amount and then you can either you know give me the give me credit card information over the phone which will be deleted after it is processed for security reasons that way your credit card information is safe or I can send you a special computer coded envelope in the mail and you can it would only take two to three days to arrive and you can put your donation in there that way and send it back to us within the next couple of weeks and you know it both both are both are safe and it would really help with our bookkeeping especially if I were to put you down for a dollar amount right away well that that does sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here and is it yeah I mean it's something that that I've been told that I should be looking at my third eldest Marissa she I think I mentioned Laura shall be four yes yes oh yeah see you she says that the boat that I should be going for something like fish but it's just a matter of what you know but what is most appropriate from the time and I guess what not so I could you just hang on for one second here hang on oh oh yes yes sir yes so sorry about but uh sorry all right there American I said I said that's perfectly all right sir oh yes so what someone did did say last week that someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you um I honestly don't know sir it could have been it could have been someone from a different location it could have been someone from a different organization honestly I don't know sorry what's your name again Benjamin Mackey well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larisa she she was talking about this just this last week and you know she's no she is very smart I'll give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yes she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well sir I you know I can I can tell you see well I mean that's a that's a very difficult question for us to answer you know we do not charge a percentage of what's raised however you know since several states require us to estimate or guarantee a percentage we are you know thus forced to guarantee that zero percent of our of your contribution will actually be used by American Center for Law and Justice for you know their nonprofit programs but we believe that it is not a technically meaningful measure because we charge it fixed fee that works out between $2 and $3 per call regardless of how much you give and you know this means we won't know the actual percentage until well after our work is completed I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch you catch you they will pull us out again well you see sir wha we're calling people who have supported the Republican Party in the past and you know with that being said as many concerned Americans are offering to contribute whatever it is they can afford because they know how that if we allow crooked Hillary to get elected in November Americans are stuck with Obamacare for who knows how long and and we'll end up with a Supreme Court that will rubber-stamp every liberal thing she pushes through with with no regard for the Constitution so mr. Trump needs you as an active member of his team and he's not looking to special interest groups or the liberal media for help he he wants good people like you to play the defining role in getting him elected so will you please help us see victory November with a more reasonable gift like $85 or $75 but the sorry again yes sir um you know it need not be that much either miss our country does it doesn't win anymore and we are losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China Mexico is feeding us at the border and on trade and it feels like every day we hear that another company is leaving our great nation we are losing millions of jobs and you know it's time for this to stop and you know this will all change when Donald Trump and Republican majorities in the House and Senate are elected in November so we will start winning again so let's count on you help us win with a gift of $50 or $35 would you show that again again please well you know miss our country doesn't win anymore and we are losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China and Mexico is beating us at the border and on trade and it feels like every day we hear that another company is leaving our great nation we're losing millions of jobs and you know it is time for this to stop and this will all change when Donald Trump and Republican majorities in the House and Senate are elected in November and we will start winning again let's count on you to help us win with a gift of $50 or $35 if great so can I put you down for the $50 or I'll put you down for the $35 sorry which company did you say you're calling from again I am calling for MDS sir well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my my eldest Rachael see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know or phone call or whatever whatever it is right right mister oh you know I'm you know I'm really sorry to hear that sir so you know I would like to ask you at the very least one more thing sir do you by any chance have an email address that we could use to send you the latest news and information oh yeah since you put it that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me hello hello hello sir hello are you there sir sir sir yes sir sorry this is I have a have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is not so good uh sorry what were you saying again well sir I was going to say thank you so much for your time and we hope that we'll have your support again very soon contributions or gifts to the Trump make America great again committee are not deductible for federal income tax purposes this call has been paid for by the Trump make America great again committee a joint fundraising committee authorized by and composed of Donald J Trump for president incorporated and the Republican National Committee look for us on the web at secure Trump 2016 dot-com and you have an amazing day sir well you know with the world finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how how it was this guy true how how was this going to work hello are you there I'm here sir I'm here sir I'm looking it up right now sorry sorry what were you saying again I'm looking it up right now sir well that that does sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here and it's yeah I mean it's something that that I've been told that I should be looking at my third oldest Marissa or she I think I mentioned Laura shall be fought yes yes um she says that that I should be going for something like this but it's just a matter of what you know but what is most appropriate from the time and I guess what not so I could you just hang on one second yeah yes I'm sorry to keep you away from your ducks sir you have a great day now goodbye
