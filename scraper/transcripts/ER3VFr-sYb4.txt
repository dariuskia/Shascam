William uh sorry I barely hear you there I was calling sir Wayne yes this is oh ok well my name is Cory I'm from sm engineering we're a utility detective company in hopkins minnesota we specialize in uncovering savings on your company's utility bills so are you person in charge of the utility bill sir well good yes yes okay perfect so sir our service is very simple and straightforward the process starts with you sending us a current utility bill for review and if your utility bills are around a thousand dollars per month I'd say it's definitely worth us taking a look our utility engineers they analyze the bill to see what opportunities exist and there's no cost or obligation for the review we notify you within 48 hours after reviewing the billet there any savings opportunities and then we discuss how we go about getting money back for your business but if there are no savings opportunities we let you know that as well have you done a utility bill analysis before oh yes yes someone
