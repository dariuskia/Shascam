Julian we are Julie I'm sorry god [ __ ] barely hear you there I'm sorry I lost my voice a few days ago so if you need me to repeat anything just let me know have you been getting a whole bunch of phone calls lately from creditors of London sir I've seen you on a daily basis yes this is okay yes okay I want to let you know first off we're not a creditor not a lender I'm not offering you any kind of money the reason that they're calling you is because your business systems as a UCC filing what we do here is we connect with business owners who have fallen victim to a predatory loan that causes that is causing hardship for their business are you making any weekly or daily payment that's causing any hardship for your business oh good yes yes you are and it's making it hard for your business correct oh yes yes someone someone did its site last week and I did someone did co last week about the same poor thing what was it was that you know I company has never called you before it says no contact history but what we do here is we work directly with business owners and we restructure their debt and we eliminate over 50% of your outstanding debt without giving you additional funds so without putting you into more done sorry what are you are you writing in week I'm calling with United settlement are you making weekly or daily payments well it's finally push because my third eldest were she was talking just last week and yeah no she is very smart valley to go to university awesome proportions but you know we're we're all quite out of focus so I'm sure she was saying that I should look you know get out into the look into this sort of thing so me and what walking well I need to ask you a few questions to make sure that you're you qualify for our program our program specifically revolves around hardships the reason that we revolve around hardships is because usually when businesses take out these loans these loans come with extremely high interest rates that often puts businesses out of business usually they're charging their clients either weekly or daily to pay off these loans the business is in a very constant thing one day is good one day could be bad but both days you get charged the same amount of money and we don't think that that's fair so what I was couldn't quite catch they pick a she level holes that again Oh again we work around businesses that are facing hardships because of these loans so maybe you guys took out a cash advance recently and you're making payments either weekly or daily and it's causing hardship for your business is any of that correct sorry again we are conducting with business owners who have taking out who have taken out high interest rate loans again again please can you hear me now yes sir is this okay again we are working with businesses who have fallen victim to predatory loans high interest rate loans from private companies sorry how are you guys making anymore arrogantly payments uttered why no you know this is taking place my last time and this way I am troubled by land operations and I went before your telling you that but why is my shoulders and I fear what this proxy they were personnel for survivors and families please things a bit more time for it okay I understand that part you know where it works right so right now okay sir -
