honda civic do still on it oh good yes yes yes okay so your file here it indicates that you have yet to extend past your vehicle's factory coverage about how many miles you currently have on it so far oh yes yes uh someone someone did kids say last week that is someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you I wasn't us personally and you know this is a different company probably because this is my record shows that we owe this is the first time that we've called you did you know I'm speaking when the Hanukkah Mentalist Michael well it's funny that you should pull because my third eldest honor sir see she was are talking about this year just last week and you know she is very smart i will give about it because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed within distinctions you know where we're all quite not very yes so um yeah she was saying that i should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing oh so what more can you tell me about it um well what i can do is i can get a honda coverage specialist on the line all they're going to do is they're going to go over your different options that you have for extended coverage they'll tell you what it covers what it costs and I mean if the price is right for you you might as well take it if not you know no harm no foul at least you know what it covers in costs I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you they will pull that again okay I was saying I'm for me to give you more information I need to get the Honda coverage specialist on the line they they have all the policies right in front of them that they have they'll tell you what it covers what it costs and all that but by you're under no obligation when you speak with them they're just here to give you a little information and if you want the warranty you can go ahead and get it if not you know at least you know what it covers and what it costs sorry again ok so I'm would you say that again please yeah the vehicle service center we do we process extended warranties so the reason why we're giving you a call is so that you could speak with the Honda coverage specialist to see what the protection would cover and what it would cost for the 2012 honda civic if if if ok so would you like to speak with one sorry which company Bruce are you calling from again the vehicle service center well you know here's here's some things because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling her that but yes I think my eldest Rachel c.c wouldn't speak to me for a week now it's I read that happens but it's big that's really good and sometimes any family these things are quite important you know they're more important than your phone call or what for what it really support okay so um what would you like to do it would you like to speak with a Honda coverage specialist to see what it would cover in class or what do you want to do oh yeah you should look that way I mean you've been quite friendly straightforward with me here hello yeah I'm here hello are you there yeah yeah I'm here to near me oh yes sorry this is I have a have a bit of a bit of a problem that this phone and my hearing it is not so good um yes sorry what were you saying again saying I did you want to speak with the honda coverage specialist to see what the protection will cover and cost for your vehicle well you know with the low finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how it was this going through how was this guy's book well what the honda coverage specialist will do is they'll tell you exactly what it covers for your vehicle like down to the each nut and bolt if they are covered he'll tell you different options that you have for the policies like there's different companies that we actually work for that their warranty companies and so there's different types of options that you would be able to choose if you end up getting the coverage but if the price is not right for you you know it's not right for you this is not the right policy for you you might just have to wait you know see if there's another come or something but our company really just gives out information about you know the warranties that we do have and this case you if you want to sign up you can if not you know it's not harm no foul well you said that does sound good i mean you have been very patient with an old man here and it is it yeah yeah I mean it's something that that I've been told that I should be looking at my third eldest Marissa or she I think I mentioned lorsha before did yes she she says that's that boat that I should be going for the something like this but it's just a matter of what you know but what is most appropriate from for the time and I guess what not happen so I could just hang on one second here hang on it so sorry about that okay sorry what were you saying there again nice i'm saying i'm if you would like to just go ahead and get a quote from our honda covery specialist oh yes yes so what someone did did say last week no did someone didn't call last week about the same thing what was it was that you know yes sorry what would what's your name again Michael well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just just last week and you know she's she is very smart I'll give her bad because you know she was the first in the family to go to university machine asp with distinction you know where we're all quite very rested so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get something into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it I mean personally I told you all the information and I can give you an order for you to get more information i actually would have to get behind a covered specialist on the line i'm sorry i couldn't quite catch it catch you they will pull us out again okay um well you know I'm kind of kind of spent a lot of time on this the phone
