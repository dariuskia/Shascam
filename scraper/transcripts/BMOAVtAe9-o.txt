Peyman how are you oh sorry I [ __ ] barely hear you there oh yeah I was calling about the merchant account for the business do you handle that or is that Carl yes this is yeah so I was calling because it's a free level one rate review have you heard of that process at all oh good yes yes yes yes so the what the deal is is they passed a federal mandate a couple years ago called the Durbin amendment and it actually capped what Visa and MasterCard could charge for many of their cards but they didn't put any regulation on any companies that actually process cards for business owners to actually give those rates so many of them just kept it as profit so our strategy is we are just kind of passing on those rates to businesses as they were intended and saving them money so that's what I was calling for today to see if we could review a couple of your statements and save you some money in hopes that you would move over to our company and change here with oh yes yes so what someone did kids say last week though did someone did call us week about the same thing what was it was that you I don't think so now yes sorry what's your name again my name is David well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and you know see she's well she is very smart I'll give her bad because you know she was the first in the family to go to university certain she passed a graph distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her so yes you're saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it yes well really what's happening is the Durbin amendment it capped what Visa MasterCard could charge okay for certain cards and it lowered a lot of those cards under 1% but the credit card companies they don't actually give those rates out because not a lot of businesses know about that mandate and so when we do a rate review we usually save a lot of money and you can you know become you would move over our sorry I'm in quite catchy catchy label what was that again well you would move over to our company called I payment and we would actually save you money and to make it worth it for you to make the change and we're actually going to pass on those rates to you as they were intended so that's what so what on the best plan of action is to if you could fax me over a statement or two I could actually fax back a template that would show how much I can save you and we could go over at line by line and hopefully you would move over to us so you two Carl doesn't do this for the business at all it's you but the Liz sorry but again Carl doesn't handle the merchant account you handle the merchant account there would you say that again again please yes I was just wondering if Carl does not do this anymore for the business you handle this aspect of the business yes yes oh very good yeah great it did you want to fax me over a statement or two and I would do a cost comparison sorry which company did you say we're calling from again a payment well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and
