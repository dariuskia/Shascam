hello hi please uh sorry I [ __ ] barely hear you there I'm sorry this would be correct good this is yeah hello mister I'm John a John Becker sir with gem solutions and we're contacting the homeowners on Park I had a quick question how long have you been the proud homeowner oh good if yeah how long have you owned the house oh yes yes so what someone did kids say last week that is someone did call last week about the same thing which was was that you know I don't recall sir um because what we're doing we're trying to contact homeowners uh because most homeowners for electricity sir um they average out to be 125 a month or more would that be the same case for you yes sorry what's your name again yeah John Becker sir and I was wondering what was the highest electric bill you saw last year well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and you know she's well she is very smart I'll give her bad because she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know we're we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into this look into this sort of thing so would what more can you tell me about it okay so um right now the government they're actually covering 30 percent of the total cost for you to go solar so that means for zero down zero out-of-pocket you could actually exchange your higher electric bill for a much lower fixed panel payment but keep in mind this isn't a lease program it's an ownership so five to 12 years you pay off the panels and after that you actually own the system outright producing your own electricity and Uncle Sam the government they're offering 30 percent tax credit and that's about 9 to 10 grand you would get when you file your taxes next year I'm sure that money could come in handy wouldn't it I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you level what was that again okay so the federal government they're offering federal tax credit which is about nine to ten grand that would come in handy around this time next year right the sorry again okay so um wouldn't having an extra 10 grand around this time next year that would be a big benefit for you wouldn't it would you say that again again please okay sure okay so the federal government they're offering a 30 percent tax credit which is about nine to ten grand if you had that around this time next year I'm sure that would be a benefit for you correct if if okay now haha what was the highest electric bill you saw in the last 12 months sorry which company did you show you're calling from again okay we're with gem solutions I'm here in Southern California sir in Tustin and all we would like to do sir is show you how many panels you need for your home and how much immediate monthly savings you would get off the bat that's it leave you the info in black and white show you what you'll be paying if you stay with the electric company and how much you'll be saving if you switch over to solar that's it but it would only make financial sense if your bills you know at a certain range what would you say the average electric bill is well you know here's a sure thing because the last time that either someone called up spoke to me on the phone I got in quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or or phone call or whatever whatever it is yes look I totally understand but let me ask you this I'm sure you got to where you're at today by making a lot of good decisions right oh yeah scissors since you you pulled up that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello yeah I'm still here sir hold on one second I mother you talked to my man Matt yeah I'm still here sir I'm gonna let you talk to my manager mark hold on one second sorry this is I have a have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is not so good yes I take sorry what were you saying again my name is Mark I'm one of the managers here I understand you don't have the greatest hearing so I'll try to speak slow and loud for you okay well I understand your dog wolf finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were well how was this going true that was a skunk bug you're going to spend less than what you're spending right now we replace your electric bill with the cheaper fixed payment for solar panels so you're not adding an additional payment you're actually reducing the cost of what you're already paying what's the highest you've seen your electric bill well are you that that does sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here and it's yeah I mean it's something that but I've been told what I should be looking at um my third oldest Marissa Marissa she I think I mentioned Laura before yes um she says that that I should be going for something like of course it's just a matter of everything what you know but what is most appropriate from that's the time and I guess you won't think so I could you just hang on for one second here hang on yeah of course yes so sorry about that oh don't apologize oh sorry what were you saying there again I just had a question for you your electric bill that you pay every month what's the highest one you've seen in the last year oh yes yes so what someone did kids say last week noted someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was that you I'm not sure it might have been uh sir I could show you a way we could save you money I just need a couple quick questions from you do you know what your electric bill average is usually what's the highest you've seen it if sorry what's your name again my name is Jason well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest Larissa she was talking about this just just last week
