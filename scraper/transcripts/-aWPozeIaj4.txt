from Comcast business uh sorry I'm [ __ ] belly hey you're there I'm sorry yes James with Comcast business I was trying to get in touch with mr. rip it is this is okay I know I thought I'd just spoken with the Lenny but yes mr. J I wanted to reach out to you my name is James with Comcast and part of the follow up team here and one to reach out cuz I attend over some information to your establishment Avenue in Nashville and I want to see if you were considering switching over to Comcast business class at all regarding it like your phone lines high-speed Internet that sort of thing oh good is it because we're actually flanking you on both sides of the street so pretty much did you know I just want to see if there was any possibility that that you possibly would give Comcast business a hard look we are definitely offering comparable prices for phone lines and high-speed internet but $30 per line for phone lines and that includes coast-to-coast calling so anywhere in the US Canada and US territories and for the high-speed Internet we're looking at you know comparable prices for for high-speed Internet let me ask you this I I know that two Foods stores at a market is someone someone did kids say last week that someone did Co last week about the same thing what was it was that here no no that this is a brand new call for me sir um I'm not quite sure who try to get in touch with you Oh Gregory Brown uh yeah he called on the second what was that Monday I believe I have I have you down for that he called on Monday but uh in short for the most part I just want to find out your needs so as far as like I know about your business uh what about your internet needs Dedes you need high-speed Internet at your a location if sorry what's your name again I'm sorry James W from Comcast business well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just just last week and you know she's well she is very smart I'll give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know we're quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well what I can tell you sir is that with a high the high-speed Internet that we're offering right now it's actually the price has been slashed in half it it's a fiber connection so it's going to be a solid constant signal we're up 9999 point nine five percent of the time so that age you and the sort of having the peace of mind of knowing that that's a solid service for one and then two you're getting the best price right now for it that's comparable to any 18 T or CenturyLink lines where they usually deal with DSL which they charge you for a signal but dear so the signal depends upon how close you are to the central office with us with fiber you have a dedicated line so you're always going to get the promised speech that you're paying towards and then also with the phone services that we have they come as a package deal and the rates that I'm showing you there's no overages so you're not going to be billed for calling anywhere in the US Canada or US territories I'm sorry but um if you if you call overseas and that's when because we're using another person's network another company's network that's when you're going to see charges for for long distance if you call overseas at all but it also falls through for for the fax line that also follows for with that should say and then of course Comcast brings video services but I know it's a business so you may not need business needs but we also have that so in short we I mean what we're able to do is definitely give you a service that you can rely upon if as far as your internet needs we're definitely meeting and I would say exceeding a lot of companies expectations as far as what they're able to do and possibly even save you money from what your current bill is especially if you look over a course of a relationship of 12 months or 24 months which a lot of people like to have just because just on a business standpoint you want once you like a price you can count on that price day-in day-out versus saying okay well I I fax something to know California or even Canada no I mean I've even heard of you know nightmare stories of getting a bill that's $80 from what it traditionally was just because they're faxing long distance and things of that nature so with us you're not going to have that issue once the lines are installed you can pretty much use them as you wish and not have to worry about a you know an outstanding bill the following month so that I mean I don't know I couldn't quite catch that cut she labeled Paulo said again though I was going to say is that you can you can count on the prices being the same day in and day out from a business standpoint so you don't have an outstanding bill I know with 18t I just talked to a customer who he had faxed a document to to Canada and it turned out to be 80 bucks on his following bill with us you're not going to have that issue because you're not going to be charged for long distance and to Canada or the US territories so that's what we're able to provide right now so a premium service at a practical rate in short but the little sorry but again it's a it's a premium service so we're offering a service that you can use and you have the peace of mind of knowing that you're not going to be getting overages and not going to be getting price hikes after a year a lot of 18t customers they get introduced to a to a price but in the actual underwriting of that contract they'll raise the rates after 12 months that's actually in their contract that the rate will change with us you're not going to have that our rate is going to be the same throughout the whole term of the contract that's why I also wanna you know point out that when you're comparing apples to apples with our no other providers they have that condition or that clause in there and their contract you're not going to have that with us would you say that again again please okay it might not come in and clear you hear me yes yes okay so what I'm saying is with 18t contracts with our with our main competitor they have an intro rate for 12 months change company did you say you're calling from again it's it's AT&T by BellSouth well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel C she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or or phone call or or or whatever whatever it is okay well I mean what I can show you is the prices that I'm able to provide at the at the service I want to I'm going to iterate that the service is going to be like night and day compared to what you currently have so in short we're leaps and bounds from our comp from our competitors where were the best service in the region I just want to show you a proposal and show you what the market is looking like compared to what you're currently receiving from your current provider and sure so is there any way that could send you a proposal you know just a quick layout of what service would look like for for your business well yeah scissors since you've you pull it that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here yeah hello hello yes I'm here yeah hello are you there hello yes I'm here hello hello oh yes sorry sorry what were you saying again no no no I was listening to you said I was being straightforward and I mean did you want to see the numbers I was I was able to provide for your business well you know with the low finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how I was this going through how was this going to work well in short I'm going to see you proposal it's a quick synopsis of what the breakdown of your business would get as far as services and pricing as you like the numbers that I show you then we can take it a step further I would get that contract signed then I would get a survey to your location just to make sure it's just like a pre install um just to see if all the lines are active in line and then we can actually install you so that that's pretty much outputs but that does sound good I mean you have been very patient with an old man here it's something that but I've told what I should be looking at my third eldest Marissa Marissa or she I think I mentioned Laura before yes yes she she says that the boat that I should be going for something like this you know what what is most appropriate from the time and I guess one okay so you hang on for one second here hang on it so sorry about that sorry what were you saying there again uh though I will say it is I could send you a proposal of the services I can provide and then you can have your third eldest Larissa look it over with you and if it makes sense we can move forward with the actual service itself so pretty much the balls in your court once I send it to you and but you let me know if you like it in short you not I mean if you like to know it's funny that you should call it because my third eldest Larissa she she was talking about this just just last week and you know you see well she is very smart I'll give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well what I want to do is I could you have is there a time that Larissa would be free where you could have her give me a call and I could relay the information to her and then she'll relay it to you and then you guys can you know decide if it makes sense does that would you feel comfortable with that I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch it level what was that again um I was saying if I could relay the information to you or Larissa your third eldest and me she could go over the numbers with you and if it make us a little sorry again but like the proposal the proposal that I'm like
