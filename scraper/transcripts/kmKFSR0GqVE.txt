Smith but we think it's because of the brand and new smart leaders that were installed in the outside of the houses recently you know the digital quote unquote smart meter from PG&E is yes uh someone someone did did say last week though did someone did call us week about the same thing what was it was that you no no no i'm calling from GC a solar were solar energy company and there's no scotty's because PG&E for the past 34 years now is they're going all over Santa Rosa replacing the meters on the outside warehouses or the digital smart meter and the PG&E admitted that they do not calibrate to the meters before the install them so a lot of homeowners here in Santa Rosa are being overcharged on their lectures on their electricity bills because of the new meters that's why was calling you to see if your bill had been affected at all I've got the new with the new smart meter did you notice your bill go up matching your meter was replaced yes sir sorry what's your name again Jeff Reynolds or the GTI well you be sure that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just just last week and she's no she is very smart I'll give her bad because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so yes she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well let me ask you first foremost because your dad is your edits I mean you're Edison this your PE electric portion of your PG&E bill go into the purified category IE 125 dollars a month or more on the average I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you they will also again okay your PG&E bill pacific gas electric they are your electric provider correct but the list sorry again the genie Pacific Gas and Electric would you say them again again please yes your utility your utility for your electric is Pacific Gas and Electric incorrect if fish okay there's your PC does your PG&E bill your electric bill average a hundred and twenty-five dollars a month or more sorry which company did you say you're calling from again GCI soul early solar energy company well we're solar company and wear something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got it quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know gobble or phone call or four or whatever whatever it is well the reason I was calling you today mrs. Smith is because pacific gas electric is notorious for charging overcharging our electric bill sometimes and since your electric bill averages 125 dollars a month or more and you're a homeowner in Santa Rosa you actually would qualify for the no-cost solar panels program and what we do is we install high-tech solar systems for no cost you simply pay for electricity that you use but it'll lower a bit of a lower rate would that be great for you oh yeah scissors since you put it that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello yes sir go ahead hello are you there yes I'm here I'm here can hear me I'm yourself okay I have a bit of a problem that this phone and my hearing it's not so good yes sorry what were you saying again I'm saying I'm asking you if your if your electric bill it was 125 dollars or more on the average we would install a solar system for your home at no cost you by E simply pay for the electricity that you use but at a lower rate and and you should be able to have a lower rate on your electric bill if your bill as a homeowner here in santa rosa is an average of one hundred and twenty-five dollars a month or more you spend over $125 well you know with the world finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how I was this going through how was a skunk book well if your electric bill is a hundred and twenty-five dollars a month on the average or higher you qualify for the no-cost solar panels program well that does sound good i mean you have been very patient with an old man here and it's yeah I mean it's something that that I've been told that I should be looking at my third eldest Marissa or she I think I mentioned Laura show before yes yes she she says that that I should be going for the something like this but sister matter what you know what is most appropriate for the time and I guess you wanna do sorry could you just hang on for one second here yes yes yes so sorry about but oh that's okay no problem sorry before your cycle are you well all I'm saying is that if you're if you're a homeowner and you own a standalone house in in santa rosa and your electric bill might be 125 dollars a month or more then you qualify for the no-cost solar panels program oh yes yes someone someone did kids say last week that is someone did call last week about the same thing is that true no is not me I mr. Smith that could have been another person it could've been another company there are literally thousands of solar companies out there he out here in California that's how you do the same thing hey sorry what's your name again my name is Jeff Reynolds sir and I'm with a customer service at GCI solar a home well its value that you should call because my third eldest Larissa yes she was talking about this just this last week and you know CeCe's know she is very smart I'll give her bad because you know she was the first and the family could go to university and see pet misses me out Miss Smith wow what about four years don't know what we're trying no we're trying to yes sir you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it how much you I need to know what you spend on your lunch bill on an average I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it I'm asking you what do you spend what do you spend on your watching bill on an average is 125 dollars a month or Lord do you know you spend on your PG&E bill but the sorry again you spend 125 dollars a month on your electric bill sir would you say that again like input sure do you spend 125 a month on your PG&E bill if if okay is it more than that normally sorry which companies you say you're calling from again GGC I the solar energy company GCI solar well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got it quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have probably shouldn't be telling you that and but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know gobble or phone call or whatever whatever it is I understand that completely mr. Smith what I'm trying to ask you though is if your electric bill is 125 dollars a month which as you just mentioned me it's over that normally then you would qualify for the no-cost solar panels program ok that's all this this is just for homeowners to help them to lower their electric bill from a teeny that's that's all this says with a solar system the Sun shines on the solar panels and they create electricity for your home and instead of that drying off the PG&E grid you make your own electricity impeaching you cannot charge you for doing that so your lunch bill gets lowered but to qualify for this program all you have to do is be a homeowner and have your bill average 125 dollars a month this does that make sense oh yeah scissors since you pulled up that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello yes sir go ahead hello are you let i'm here i'm still here yes I'm here I'm not gonna weigh mr. Smith oh yes I'm sorry this is I have a have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is also good yes sorry what were you saying again we want to come to give you and anybody you want to be there we want to give you a free estimate and evaluation for your home to help you go solar if possible we would have we makin a morning or evening or afternoon appointment whichever works best for you and we would have our state licensed technician to come to give you and larissa a no-cost no-obligation estimate for free where he'd be able to tell you exactly how many solar panels would take a lower your bill but most importantly how much money you'll save now that's what I'm trying to get to is helping you to be able to go solar if possible but we're not going to be able to determine that unless number one you have an electric bill averaging 125 dollars a month or more this way we have to you know we have to be able to have your bill big enough to lower our goal is to save you money every single month and that's why we ask that you pay at least $125 on average every single month because if you are then we know we can save you money does that make sense well you know with the low finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how I was this going through how is this sector well what I'm talking about is a free solar panels program which helps homeowners to lower their electric bill now if you're spending 125 dollars per month or averaging that much on your electric bill what we want to do is have you pay less for electricity by going solar for no cost this is the no cost solar panels program but to qualify you have to be home owner which you are mr. Smith you own your home here in santa rosa and your electric bill need to be an average of one hundred twenty-five dollars a month or more which you have a bill that high normally collect well are you that does sound good i mean you have been very patient with an old man here and is it old a nose met me a closer it's something that but I've been told that I should be looking at okay my third hour Larissa she I think I mentioned Laura shall befall yes yes she she says that note that I should be going for something like this but it's just a matter of what you know but what is most appropriate from the well that's most probably we whether it would be hang on for one second fear hang on yes yes so sorry about but oh no problem do you live near a duck pond or a deck lake oh yes yes someone someone did kids say last week and I did someone did koloff's week about the same thing what was it was that you no sir it was not i but the company i'm calling from the GCI solar and I was actually calling you about your electric bill and you know if your electric bill averages at least 125 dollars per month and you and not have been approved for any other discounts by pge you may qualify for the solar discount program and we might be able to help you to go solar for no constant what we would do is we don't have our state licensed technician to come to give you and Loretta she has to be there because he is the one who connects you with this stuff we'd have our stabilizer technician to come to give you a no-cost no-obligation estimate for free where I say my technician can tell you all about the program explain it to you in detail and leave the information with you and if you like what you see and you want to go solar for your home there then you'd be able to help you go solar by its own resources and then no cost and what you wind up paying for is the energy only but in the cheaper less expensive rate than pge there's a money saver but to qualify you have to be a homeowner and have your bill average 125 dollars a month does that make sense sorry what's your name again a my name is Jeffrey Jeff Reynolds sir yes sir now what I'm going to do for you mr. Smith is I'm going to transfer you over to my scheduling Department and they'll take the time or two to make an employment time and day for our technician to come to give you and Larissa the free estimate that in the evaluation for your home there would that be okay well it's pay that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and you know CeCe's know she is very smile I'll give him at because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and she passed with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yes she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing so what more can you tell me about it well this is for homeowners that are spending 125 dollars a month you are a homeowner correct mr.
