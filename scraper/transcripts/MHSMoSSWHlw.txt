this is a demonstration of the few things one is the script I wrote using autohotkey that works with OBS open broadcast software and PowerPoint it allows me to use this remote to change my PowerPoint slides and when I do that the scene in OBS also changes so that I broadcast the slide that I'm talking about when I'm done changing my slides I can go back to the camera if I don't want to use the remote I can use the keys on the laptop keyboard left and right to change my slides and if I want to change slides without the viewers seeing what I'm doing I can use shift and the arrow keys the other thing I'm demonstrating is this microphone that I'm using right now I bought this microphone for 10 dollars from Aliexpress it shipped from China and this the sound quality from this microphone is comparable to the ones I buy locally for a little under $200 for that kind of savings I'm not going to lose sleep over being a bad Canadian
