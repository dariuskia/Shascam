you uh sorry I [ __ ] barely hear you there hello come speak to mr. cool hello yes this is he ok can you hear me now sir oh good if you love it all right my name is Austin Smith and I was just calling in regards to your national great utility bill we actually tried to contact you a few months ago to let you know about summer rates increasing so we sent out a message printed on page two of your bill just to follow up with you to let you know about it increasing but you are entitled to receive a discount rate reduction and my job is just to follow with you and let you know what you are entitled to verbally and make sure you have the proper adjustments already made on your bill but if not I will adjust to race down today for you oh yeah hello mrs. someone someone did say last week though did someone did call offs week about the same thing what was yes you yes it was it was someone from my company yes they were following up with you and did they set up on your lower fixed rate for you then yes sorry what's your name again my name's Austin Austin Smith well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just just last week and she she's no she is very smart I'll give about it because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and see right house with distinctions you know where yes so they were saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing um yeah so yeah that's all over the mortgage tell me about it oh well you're entitled to a discounted rate reduction on your kilowatt hours so you aren't impacted by any increases coming along with the summer and basically you'll be taking a fixed rate and a fixed rate your race can't from the time period that you had that rate set in place most people they pay a variable rate and they don't know that available rate increases on a month-to-month basis so that's why you see your bill increase on a few months and you likewise my bill going up it's because they're increasing your rates you pay per kilowatt hour but you are entitled to a nine cent per kilowatt-hour and that is a fixed rate so it won't move for three months and that's a fixed rate for three months so you won't see increase in your race or in your bill for over the three-month period but no need to worry about the three month because before your three months in 30 days out I will follow up with you ask you how you like your savings mr. how do you how you pronounce your last name I don't want to pronounce the wrong I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you they will go second I said I said how do you pronounce your last name I don't want to pronounce it wrong but the sorry again your your last name pronounced it for me would you say that again again please your your last name how do you pronounce it is it is see correct yes yes all right yes and you know you will I will follow up with you 30 days before their three-month period ends and I'll put you on another lower fixed rate for the fall because rates go down during the fall season so you will be paying less than nine cent per kilowatt-hour at a fixed rate for the fall season and you can actually extend that rate over into the winter because rates go back up in the winter so you can be on a low fixed fall rate going into the winter while they're increasing rates for the winter you won't see increase in your rate at all so it's really good thing and it's great for people that's like on a fixed income or for grateful people that just like to be budgeted out just like to budget their bills around a certain amount every month so it's great for people like that so my job is just to make sure that all of your information I have here its current and we know we would do a bill review together and I will see your way your race all right now and I'll adjust those rates down to the nine cent that you are entitled to but first I have to make sure that your servers address is still the same i have your 50 is that correct sorry which company did you say you're calling from again oh we all can call them by your national grid bill the utility bill the national grid well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got it quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see see what wouldn't speak to me for a week you know that's it Wow but you must increase it will really hurt and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important if they're more important than hey you know y'all boys I told I totally agree what whatever it takes I totally agree but no this is just to take a discount off of your electricity bill so you can be paying less money on your electricity bill this isn't going to increase anything or you don't have to pay to sign up or anything you have to pay to counsel out or anything it's just something that you are entitled to being a consumer for national grid you are entitled to a discounted rate on your own supply usage of your bill but know this this will actually give you some get you some praise for your family from saving them some money on the electric bill the right we'll shake your hand and thank you and said you made up for you know your mistake that you may make them not speak to you oh yeah your sisters since you pulled up that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here oh yeah oh yes of course hello yes I'm here sir hello are you there come on hello yes I'm here you hear me oh yeah shallows sorry this is I have a have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is so good yes sorry what were you saying again no I was saying that um this is a good choice for you this will actually you know help you save money on your electricity bill so your family will give you some praise for doing a good thing and you know saving some money this won't be a mistake like you had that you've made before to where you know you said your family wasn't speaking to you they were actually praise you for this one and give you a handshake for you know taking a discount on your utility bill well you know with the world finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how I was this guy true how is this going to book okay well what we would do is you would grab a copy of your bill and I would direct you to the supply section where your rates are and I will have you tell me the race that date that you are paying right now and I've seen people in Bristol County pay as high as like 15 to 18 cents per kilowatt hour so if you're paying any with anywhere between higher than the nine cent that you are entitled to I will bring it down to that nine cent at a fixed rate and you won't see that nine cent increase while they are bringing increases along so basically you will see a deduction in your bill from fifteen to twenty five percent let's say if your bill right now is 80 something dollars and you're paying 13 cents per kilowatt and I bring your kilowatts down to nine cents that 80 some dollar bill will come down to a fifty dollars fifty some dollar bill well are you that that does sound good i mean you have been very patient with an old man here and there's no problem yeah yeah I mean it's something that but I've told that I should be looking at yes my third eldest Marissa or she I think I mentioned Laura shall befall you see um she says that note that I should be going for me something like this right it's just a matter of what you know what what is to procreate from the time and I guess you are not think so I could just hang on for one second here hang on sure sure take your time yes so sorry about but oh no problem no problem what were your swag Merrigan I was saying you know I will adjust your rates down for you today to get you on some savings and you said you know your sister spoke to you about this you know getting on a fixed rate so you know you can budget out from a month to month you can basically predict what your bill is going to be and 11 your bill won't be hunting hundred and something dollars and it's going higher and higher your bill will stay around the same amount on a month-to-month basis and your sister is actually very smart because you know basically you can predict which you're going to pay the electricity people they you're not letting them just send you a bill and just telling you all you owe this much well you owe this much we're taking a fixed rate you can basically predict what you're going to pay them on a month-to-month basis instead of them predicting what you need to pay on the month of my faces are they make sense someone someone did did say last week though did someone did call last week about the same thing what was it was I have you it probably was not actually just did a follow-up call I had in my system I had a follow-up call that I was supposed to call you back call you back so I actually just call you first this morning just to see how you were doing and see how you know if you would want to lower your glittery cityville yes sorry what's your name again my name is Austin Austin Smith well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and you know she's not she is very smart I'll give her bad because you know she was the first in the family could go to university and see us with distinctions you know where we're all quite about of her yes yes so um yeah she was saying that I should look you know get into the into this sort of thing right so right what more can you tell me about it all right well um basically you will be you know you would have this summer rate lock in you won't see any increases in your bill or in your rates your bill is going to be around the same amount every month and whatever you're paying now I can reduce it down to at least fifteen percent so you can save that much going here forward into the summer season because they are raising rates in the summer season our peak season is summer and our peak season is winter because in the summer people tend to use the AC moore and in the winter people tend to use the heat more so that's why rates go up in that time but the spring and the fall season rates go down because those are our cooler months you know we get rain and everything so electricity isn't that high so that's why we're giving you this lower fixed rate for the summer so you can be protected by any increases coming along with the summer they can't increase your race or increase your bill so when the fall come around you'll get a renewal package you know offering you a lower fixed rate than the nine cent for the fall season like I told you earlier rates go up in the winter so you can actually take your lower all fixed rate and sign up for six months so it'll roll over into the winter so you won't be hit by any increasing rates coming with the winter season either this is it's a really good thing it's a really good famous because you know you can save money and you're not being priced gouged by the electricity company then I they're not raising your rates and making you pay extremely high bills they actually can't do that anymore oh my gosh couldn't quite captures at the country level for silicon oh oh but they can't raise your rates anymore because you're going on a fixed rate and you're in a fixed rate it can't increase for the time period you have your fixed rate in place now right now you're paying a variable rate and with your variable rate they increase it on a month-to-month basis that's why you see a little increase in your electricity bill on a month-to-month basis because you're on a variable rate now if you're on a fixed rate they can't increase your rates so your bill will stay the same mister and like I said it's a little sorry again and like i said it's great for people that's on a fix a fixed income because it's basically you is basically budgeted out you can basically budget your electricity bill on a month-to-month basis because you can predict how much is going to be on a month-to-month basis instead of 11 your bill being 80 something dollars and then the next month your bill being a hundred and something dollars your bill will always stay at let's say sixty bucks a month going forward so if you can go again please sure your rates per kilowatt hour they won't increase because you'll be on a fixed rate but right now you're paying a variable rate and they are increasing your rates on a month-to-month basis because that's how the variable rate works that you're paying right now they increase it but the fixed rate that i'm going to give you today at nine cents they cannot increase that rate so you won't see an increase in your rate or your bill your bill will be the same on a month-to-month basis okay it's okay now if you could grab a copy of your bill we're going to review it together and I'm going to adjust your race down okay and I'll hold the line sorry which company did you say you're calling from again national grid electricity well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone calls up and spoke to me on the phone I got it quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have probably be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see see what wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that real it and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know global or phone call or whatever whatever it is yes yeah but this this this is actually a good thing actually your family will appreciate you for lessening the electricity bill this isn't going to increase your business actually is going to save you all a lot of money going forward now I understand the mistakes you made in the past and the decisions you made in the past wasn't the right decision for your family but this here is a good decision for your family because you will be decreasing your electricity bill you can basically take your bill from 50 bucks 225 books now if your sister you said your sister right now if she was to see her hurt that you guys electricity bill go from fifty dollars to $25 do you think she would be mad oh yeah sisters since you've looked that way I mean you've been quite friendly strike sword with me here hello hello I'm here sir hello are you there yeah I'm here sir you hear me can you hear me now yes sorry I have a bit of a bit of a problem that this phone and my hearing and I'm not neither good yes sorry what were you saying again now I was saying um if your sister seen that your you guys bill went from 50 bucks 225 bucks do you think she will be mad well you know with the world finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how it was this going through how was asked eichenberg all right well if you can grab a copy of your bill i will explain i will show you how is gonna work well okay but that does sound good i mean you have been very patient with an old man here and is it thank you yeah I mean it's something that but I've been told that I should be looking at that my third eldest Marissa she i think i mentioned Laura show before yes yes she she says that note that I should be going for me getting lice ish yes it's just a matter of what you know but what is most appropriate from for the Brian and I guess you are not do so I could just hang on for one second here hang on sure yes so sorry about that sorry what were you saying they're good i was saying grab a copy of your national great utility bill so we

grab a copy of your bill your natural grid electricity bill I can show you where your savings is going to take place if all right well I'll hold the line while you grab a copy of your bill ok sorry obvious which company did you show your calling from again the national grid electricity well you know his peers something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got in quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have right right be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she wouldn't speak to me for me now you know then that happens it home but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more importance than you know that it or phone call or water for whatever it is right is basically you're taking a discount on your electricity bill sir it just is your sister around for me to speak with her oh yeah your sisters since you you pull up that way maybe you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here hello hello hello are you there hello yes I'm here oh yes hello sorry this is I have a have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is also good hello this is Lenny hi mastic with mr. oh sorry I [ __ ] Billy here you there I'm sorry I'm ethically mystical yes this is how you doing today sir my name is Matt I'm just trying to do a follow-up call with your national grid bill did you get a chance to review that information oh good okay great so we are going to go ahead and lower your rate from the higher variable and give you a discount this somewhere and put it at nine point nine cents just want to verify your kik account information is 15 crack is someone someone did kids say last week though did someone did call us week about the same thing what was it was that you no sir this is my first time giving you a call but we may have reached out because your savings hasn't been applied to your account yet so we are making every effort to make sure that you do save money this year sorry what's your name again Matt em apt now do you have a current or past copy of your national grid bill so i can show you exactly where your savings is going to be applied at well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just just last week and you know she's no she is very smart I'll give her that because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and seem harsh with distinctions you know where we're all quite proud of her yes yes so um yes she was saying that I should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing um of course what more can you tell me about it sure of course now basically what's happening is is you know National Grid delivers the energy to your home but they go to multiple suppliers to get the actual energy there's different suppliers applying the energy and then it travels down the line to the power to transporters into the power plant and then distributed to your home from national grid national grid has you on a variable rate because every month what supplier they choose to get the energy for your home is consistently different one month it may be this supplier one month maybe that supplier one month it may be another supplier so your rate is called a variable rate which means you're going to be charged whatever they charge you and you have to pay the bill at the end of the month so what we're doing now is letting you know that during the summer season when those rates typically go up between eleven to fifteen cents per kilowatt we're going to offer you the national standard of nine point nine which will take effect for july august and sep tember when that happens you'll actually be able to pretty much predict your bill and know exactly how much is going to be almost if you look at page 2 on the back of your national grid bill you've been provided with the last six six months of your kilowatt history and you could average out your typical usage multiply that by 0.0 99 and you would pretty much have your bill mapped out for you kind of gives you a little leeway to budget your billing and it also gives you some savings without seeing a high increase in your bill this year if you decide to turn the air conditioning on any more questions or concerns like an answer for you I'm sorry I couldn't quite catch it catch you they will what was that again I'm any more questions but the little sorry again for how you're saving okay so i'll show you how about I show you that'll probably be a little easier can you grab one of your national grid bills and I'm going to show you how to wear a look and show it to you in black and white would you say that again again please sure grab a copy of your bill if if if okay let me know when you have to deal with you sorry which company did you say you're calling from again we're alagar the supplier of energy to national grid well you know here's here's something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got in quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes I think my eldest Rachel see she would wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but did that will and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know job or phone call or whatever whatever it is scraps well the good thing about dismiss as I don't know why they would be upset with you if you're just trying to save money on your electric bill I'm pretty sure if you're if you're your sister and your daughters and they went to the University and they have a really great education and they're very smart like you said then they would probably be very glad that you saved money on your own instead of continuing Lee paying for more paying more than you have to like if I if I called you mr. told you I paid twenty dollars a gallon for gas today but I could have got it for four dollars would you be mad at me if I took it for four dollars instead would you not talk to me for a week because i only paid four dollars instead of twenty dollars oh yeah sisters since you've flipped that way I mean you've been quite friendly and straightforward with me here um thank you so right hello yes sir I said thank you sir alright cellular yes sir I'm here oh yes sorry this is I have a have a bit of a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is not so good yes Oh what we're sorry what were you saying again so now what we can do is you can just grab a copy of your bill just grab one of your bills and we're going to go ahead and apply the right if your sister or daughter gets mad at you for saving money you can call us and we'll put you back if spending more money well you know with the low financials lat our I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how I was this guy true that was a skyped book um we're going to verify your account number we're going to place the new lower rate on your bill and now every hour that you sit at home and use electricity you're going to be paying less well you said that does sound good i mean you have been very patient with an old man here and it's yeah I mean it's something that that I've been told that I should be looking at my third eldest Marissa or she I think I mentioned Laura show
