countries and it's coming back this year to the US it's being held in Los Angeles at the end of July now that means our athletes from New York get a great opportunity to be a part of this event but more importantly they meet and interact with athletes from around the world with similar disabilities that's important for them because it's about developing their confidence and their self-esteem don't you agree oh good if yeah so what we're trying to do is obviously try to get as many new athletes involved as possible and out to LA to represent in New York as a special event and we're asking you to help us out we're doing something a little different this year we're asking you to take out a short one-time subscription to a favorite magazine they're up to 80% off the cover price we don't

Illustrated to Golf Digest Rolling Stone of Family Handyman Discover Magazine Smithsonian or we can renew something that you're already getting because we are dealing with the publishers which is just
