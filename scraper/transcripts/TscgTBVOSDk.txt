this is automatically because I get start talking too loud the computer phones shush me down sorry Lenny it's Deborah I'm with people's choice about a savings through the states of all good this is ray upon the electric ray told me you handle that is that correct oh yes yes someone someone did kids say last week no did someone did call offs week about the same thing what was it was that review it was not me this is my first time speaking with ray in yourself but we are at first of all I gotta tell you our calls are recorded for quality Lenny but we're showing you folks are not participating and it can result in a sometimes at ten to thirty percent rate reduction sometimes even more than that is how I'm sorry what's your name again in avenal well it's funny that you should call because my third eldest larissa see she was talking about this just this last week and it's a variety sees no she is very smart i'll give him at because you know she was the first in the family to go to university and see past with distinctions you know where we're all quite so um yes she was saying that i should look you know get into the look into this sort of thing he is all right what more can you tell me about it what happens is this see the state deregulated the utilities money because people demanded some choices so what the state said was that we will be allowed to select our suppliers now in the utility continues to handle billing sorry Iver bear it was quite maintaining everything's an emergency services like outages so the only difference is what you actually pay for the energy so if you stay with the utility do you pay more yes select a supplier yep a left the best way to tell what you can save it is to grab a recent bill and I'll show you how how do you know what we can save on that account but the literature sorry again you you'll want to grab a recent bill and I'll show you exactly on a bill what we can save you could you say that again again please if you would grab a recent bill many you know you want an electric bill exactly what we can save you hello are you there I am here can you hear me oh yes sorry okay sorry what Corey many I'm gonna call you from another phone okay sorry I which company did you say you're calling from again our company is People's Choice energy were brokers and we work with a number of different suppliers but we work for the customer now in Connecticut I work for you know we notify businesses that have both the UI and eversource accounts well you know it's fun do you have there something because the last time that either someone called up and spoke to me on the phone I got it quite a bit of trouble from the people here because I went for something that I shouldn't have I probably shouldn't be telling you that but yes no my eldest racial she wouldn't speak to me for a week now you know then that happens you know but it did that really hurt and and and sometimes in family you know these these things are quite important you know they're more important than any you know gobble or phone call or whatever it course this and this is how we work at Lenny what I do is test a bill and then I can show you what you know you'll clearly see what you're paying without the supplier then I'll suggest a supplier and then we can calculate that bill and see what you would have paid how do you had the supplier on the account at that time then what we do is once you and I agree to rate term start date and that supplier we use a third-party recorded verification process Lenny to confirm what you and I agreed to from that you get a confirmation number and then you get everything in the mail it does take about five a business day to receive their called welcome packages from the supplier that package includes full customer terms and conditions confirmation of the enrollment of course and instructions on canceling in case you change your mind now because we're brokers I'm going to function on your behalf or rather than the suppliers pfaff oh you should I out we more that way I mean you don't think what friendly and straightforward with me here hello i am here hello are you there lenny i am here oh yes Lana sorry I'm here a bit of a problem with this phone and my hearing is not so good yes sorry what were you saying again why don't you um is it possible for me to speak with your daughter the one that reminds you to check into this again well you know with the world finances the way they are I know you know we're not allowed to spend as much as what we were how how how was this guy true how was this guy can [ __ ] well what we do is we take information from the bill and then once you agree on that recording that you want the lower rate you want to pay less money you'll have a confirmation number then we send everything over to the utility they put the reduced rate on your bill and they pick the suppliers on on the bill and then you still pay the regular utility company just like you always have done and let's say it's a 12 month term I often do 12 months in the state of Connecticut your you you don't have to do a thing ever so you get that fixed rate we handle getting it over to ever sourcing having them apply that rate to the account and then we will call you prior to the end of the term to remind you that you're coming up for we know all that way your are
